A data set of 110,424 commits referring to regular expressions.
These are 0.19% of the commits.

The [corrective commit probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10912), effort dedicated to bug fixes is 46.7%, 92% higher than the 24.3% in all commits.
The average commit duration is 111 minutes, 26% higher than 88 minutes on all commits (in the same date).
Regex commits that are also related to performance are 3.4%, 277% higher than 0.9%.
Regex commits that are also related to security are 2.2%, 100% higher than 1.1%.
Regex commits are found in average after about 11 days, 68% higher than about 7 days for the rest.

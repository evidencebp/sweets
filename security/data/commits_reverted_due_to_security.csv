This commit was revert because for some users it breaks VPN PPTP.
We decided that is should be enought to remove kmod-nf-nathelper-extra
from user package list and add note about this vulnerability to errata.

In that case it's up to users if they decide to install affected kernel module.

","Don't bypass CSP restrictions on eval from the console

Previously the console would allow evals even when the target page
blocked evals via Content Security Policy. This made it hard to debug
CSP-related issues on the page because users couldn't reproduce CSP
eval errors in the console.

Use the new flag to Runtime.evaluate() that will cause CSP failures
for eval from the console, if CSP on the page prevents unsafe eval.

Add a test.

* Migrated codebase from rails 4.0 to 4.2, also removed most of the version specifications from the gem dependencies and ran bundle update

* Commented out api test since it is incomplete and references a missing fixture. Also commented out stubbed performance test because that functionality is no longer a part of rails

* Added js preventDefault to modal popup functions to prevent them from appearing and immediately disappering

* removed deprecated link_to_object function from helpers/application.rb and added client side js script to add new options to a question.

* Upgraded select2 js file

* Removed all accepts_nested_attributes_for for belongs_to associations because they were creating circular calls in ActiveRecord.

* Fixed add/remove option js

* Fixed i18n calls in erb files that were missing an equal sign (e.g. <% t('value'') %> --> <%= t('value') %> so that the value will appear to the user. Also updated i18n calls from admin.js with 'js.' prefix)

When receive.enableProtocolV2 is set to true, set the necessary extra
parameters on the UploadPack to tell JGit to handle the request with
protocol v2.

Note that according to JGit's implementation, the git config on the
repository on the server must also be configured to use protocol v2.

This can be achieved either by setting it globally in the gerrit
user's ~/.gitconfig or per repository in the repository's .git/config:

  [protocol]
    version = 2

Test plan:
  - Set protocol.version to 2 in the project's server-side config (or
    in the gerrit user's ~/.gitconfig)

  - Clone the project over SSH or HTTP

  - From the client, run:
    GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git -c protocol.version=2 ls-remote

    (one can also configure this permanently on the local project by
     running `git config protocol.version 2`)

  - Observe the packet output including:
    git< version 2

Reason for revert: The original revert was done because of security
vulnerability. Ref advertise filter was not called by Git v2 protocol
JGit layer. Gerrit does not rely any more on ref filter being called
by JGit. Gerrit provides a custom repository to JGit. The repository

Reason for revert: The original revert was done because of security
vulnerability in JGit. This vulnerability was fixed meantime.

Another argument for procrastination with Git v2 protocol support in
upcoming Gerrit release may be the fact that we do not have any
integration tests for execution of AdvertiseRefsHook hook.

However, this argument is not specific for git v2 protocol, as
mentioned in JGit 5.0 release: [1], but other Git protocol versions
were affected as well, and thus does not hold. In fact bidirectional
v0 HTTP protocol also has not executed AdvertiseRefsHook hook and
this was not discovered for 8 years and all released Gerrit versions
were affected.

Test Plan:

1. Install git version 2.18 or later
2. Activate git v2 protocol on the client side
3. Enable git v2 protocol support in gerrit, by setting this config:
   receive.enableProtocolV2 = true
3. Run $ GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git ls-remote
4. Confirm that git v2 protocol is used
5. Confirm that the method: DefaultRefFilter#filter is get called
6. Confirm that the call stack looks sane: [2]

This reverts commit fcc90699fdec17b941a473221d228c832a533fc0.

Reason for revert: Security vulnerability for OAuth and OpenID auth
schemes.

OAuth and OpenID authentication schemes support multiple identity
providers, e.g.: CAS-OAuth2 and GitHub-OAuth2. An attacker can easily
impersonate existing Gerrit user by creating account on a different
provider with exactly the same username as the existing Gerrit account.
Instead of creating a fresh new user, the new account is erroneously
linked to the existing Gerrit account, even though, account linking
feature was not triggered from the Gerrit UI.

The original commit tried to fix intermittent database corruption
problem, with missing record in the database, in the context of single
identity provider (LDAP) where such problem doesn't exist, as there is
no way that one single username can belong to physical different users.
Nevertheless, there should be found another workaround, as trying to
recover on the fly and introducing severe security breach for other auth
schemes supported in Gerrit.

If all else fails, the missing database record has to be inserted
manually and the corresponding account must be re-indexed.

","Fix the missing DB entry in Gerrit DB

Due to an unknown reason (still under investigation), a few of the new
LDAP users were not able to login after first time because the Gerrit DB
was missing one of the two entries needed to authenticate the user (the
second entry is only needed for the users with non-null usernames).
The entry with external Id - ""gerrit:abc"" was never inserted to DB
in such cases whereas the entry with external id - ""username:abc"" was
created resulting in an account creation for the user.

This causes inconsistency in the DB. An account gets created in first login
attempt and second attempt fails to create missing external id because the
""username:abc"" entry already exists causing the DB action to rollback.

As this bug is very infrequent and hard to replicate, this change
provides an after-fix for the issue i.e. fixes the problem when an entry
is missing in Gerrit DB. It checks if there exists an account already
for the given username and links the newly created external ID to that
account. It prevents the need to manually enter the missing entries in
DB to solve the issue.

","Exclude bouncycastle key files to fix SecurityException upon plugin-api

Exclude the 2 bouncycastle key files from the 2 downloaded jar files
that are repackaged into our gerrit plugin-api jar. Do so in order to
fix a SecurityException [1] thrown upon using the plugin api from plugin
IT tests [2] in standalone (non-tree) mode.

Indeed, BCKEY.DSA and BCKEY.SF used to be repackaged under META-INF/ in
our gerrit plugin-api jar. Doing so caused that exception [1], as such
BCKEY files did not properly sign our built plugin-api jar; they
strictly belonged to their 2 mother bouncycastle jar files. Our jar used
to have 2 sets of such key files, one set coming from bcprov and the
other from bcpg (the 2 bouncycastle libs involved herein). This fix
removes them all 4 (BC key files) from the resulting plugin-api jar:

jar tvf gerrit-plugin-api-2.12-SNAPSHOT.jar | grep BCKEY
=> (before this fix)
 26965 Sun Mar 01 12:09:10 EST 2015 META-INF/BCKEY.SF

  2219 Sun Mar 01 12:09:32 EST 2015 META-INF/BCKEY.DSA

This fix is first for plugin IT tests [2], which expose this issue as
the first 'pure' plugin-api jar loaders. Such BC libs started to be
-needfully- introduced in acceptance testing by commit ed170f3.

    MDEV-12428 SIGSEGV in buf_page_decrypt_after_read() during DDL

    Also, some MDEV-11738/MDEV-11581 post-push fixes.

    In MariaDB 10.1, there is no fil_space_t::is_being_truncated field,
    and the predicates fil_space_t::stop_new_ops and fil_space_t::is_stopping()
    are interchangeable. I requested the fil_space_t::is_stopping() to be added
    in the review, but some added checks for fil_space_t::stop_new_ops were
    not replaced with calls to fil_space_t::is_stopping().

    buf_page_decrypt_after_read(): In this low-level I/O operation, we must
    look up the tablespace if it exists, even though future I/O operations
    have been blocked on it due to a pending DDL operation, such as DROP TABLE
    or TRUNCATE TABLE or other table-rebuilding operations (ALTER, OPTIMIZE).
    Pass a parameter to fil_space_acquire_low() telling that we are performing
    a low-level I/O operation and the fil_space_t::is_stopping() status should
    be ignored.

    MDEV-11738: Mariadb uses 100% of several of my 8 cpus doing nothing

    MDEV-11581: Mariadb starts InnoDB encryption threads
    when key has not changed or data scrubbing turned off

    Background: Key rotation is based on background threads
    (innodb-encryption-threads) periodically going through
    all tablespaces on fil_system. For each tablespace
    current used key version is compared to max key age
    (innodb-encryption-rotate-key-age). This process
    naturally takes CPU. Similarly, in same time need for
    scrubbing is investigated. Currently, key rotation
    is fully supported on Amazon AWS key management plugin
    only but InnoDB does not have knowledge what key
    management plugin is used.

    This patch re-purposes innodb-encryption-rotate-key-age=0
    to disable key rotation and background data scrubbing.
    All new tables are added to special list for key rotation
    and key rotation is based on sending a event to
    background encryption threads instead of using periodic
    checking (i.e. timeout).

    fil0fil.cc: Added functions fil_space_acquire_low()
    to acquire a tablespace when it could be dropped concurrently.
    This function is used from fil_space_acquire() or
    fil_space_acquire_silent() that will not print
    any messages if we try to acquire space that does not exist.
    fil_space_release() to release a acquired tablespace.
    fil_space_next() to iterate tablespaces in fil_system
    using fil_space_acquire() and fil_space_release().
    Similarly, fil_space_keyrotation_next() to iterate new
    list fil_system->rotation_list where new tables.
    are added if key rotation is disabled.
    Removed unnecessary functions fil_get_first_space_safe()
    fil_get_next_space_safe()

    fil_node_open_file(): After page 0 is read read also
    crypt_info if it is not yet read.

    btr_scrub_lock_dict_func()
    buf_page_check_corrupt()
    buf_page_encrypt_before_write()
    buf_merge_or_delete_for_page()
    lock_print_info_all_transactions()
    row_fts_psort_info_init()
    row_truncate_table_for_mysql()
    row_drop_table_for_mysql()
        Use fil_space_acquire()/release() to access fil_space_t.

    buf_page_decrypt_after_read():
        Use fil_space_get_crypt_data() because at this point
        we might not yet have read page 0.

    fil0crypt.cc/fil0fil.h: Lot of changes. Pass fil_space_t* directly
    to functions needing it and store fil_space_t* to rotation state.
    Use fil_space_acquire()/release() when iterating tablespaces
    and removed unnecessary is_closing from fil_crypt_t. Use
    fil_space_t::is_stopping() to detect when access to
    tablespace should be stopped. Removed unnecessary
    fil_space_get_crypt_data().

    fil_space_create(): Inform key rotation that there could
    be something to do if key rotation is disabled and new
    table with encryption enabled is created.
    Remove unnecessary functions fil_get_first_space_safe()
    and fil_get_next_space_safe(). fil_space_acquire()
    and fil_space_release() are used instead. Moved
    fil_space_get_crypt_data() and fil_space_set_crypt_data()
    to fil0crypt.cc.

    fsp_header_init(): Acquire fil_space_t*, write crypt_data
    and release space.

    check_table_options()
    	Renamed FIL_SPACE_ENCRYPTION_* TO FIL_ENCRYPTION_*

    i_s.cc: Added ROTATING_OR_FLUSHING field to
    information_schema.innodb_tablespace_encryption
    to show current status of key rotation.

    MDEV-11943 I_S.TABLES inconsistencies with tables with unknown storage engine

    Try harder to show the table's engine.

    If the table's engine is not loaded, the table won't open.
    But we can still read the engine name from frm as a string.

    MDEV-11943 I_S.TABLES inconsistencies with tables with unknown storage engine

    Make SELECT <columns> FROM I_S.TABLES behave identically independently
    from whether <columns> require opening the table in engine or
    <columns> can be filled with only opening the frm.

    In particular, fill_schema_table_from_frm() should not silently skip
    frms with unknown engine, but should fill the I_S.TABLES row
    with NULLs just like fill_schema_table_by_open() does.

    If openat is not present on the system, we use the alternative open call, with
    slightly different logic. IF the symlink doesn't point to a valid file,
    we get errno 20. This test uses an invalid symlink on the table t1.MYD.

    Bug#18411494 WRONG COMPARSION ON BIG DECIMAL VALUES

    Problem: integer literals may be converted to floats for
    comparison with decimal data. If the integers are large,
    we may lose precision, and give wrong results.

    Fix: for
      <non-const decimal expression> <cmp> <const string expression>
      or
      <const string expression> <cmp> <non-const decimal expression>
    we override the compare_type chosen by item_cmp_type(), and
    do comparison as decimal rather than float.

    MDEV-11520 after-merge fix for 10.1: Use sparse files.

    If page_compression (introduced in MariaDB Server 10.1) is enabled,
    the logical action is to not preallocate space to the data files,
    but to only logically extend the files with zeroes.

    fil_create_new_single_table_tablespace(): Create smaller files for
    ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED tables, but adhere to the minimum file size of
    4*innodb_page_size.

    fil_space_extend_must_retry(), os_file_set_size(): On Windows,
    use SetFileInformationByHandle() and FILE_END_OF_FILE_INFO,
    which depends on bumping _WIN32_WINNT to 0x0600.
    FIXME: The files are not yet set up as sparse, so
    this will currently end up physically extending (preallocating)
    the files, wasting storage for unused pages.

    os_file_set_size(): Add the parameter ""bool sparse=false"" to declare
    that the file is to be extended logically, instead of being preallocated.
    The only caller with sparse=true is
    fil_create_new_single_table_tablespace().
    (The system tablespace cannot be created with page_compression.)

    fil_space_extend_must_retry(), os_file_set_size(): Outside Windows,
    use ftruncate() to extend files that are supposed to be sparse.
    On systems where ftruncate() is limited to files less than 4GiB
    (if there are any), fil_space_extend_must_retry() retains the
    old logic of physically extending the file.

    MDEV-12075 innodb_use_fallocate does not work in MariaDB Server 10.1.21

    fil_space_extend_must_retry(): When innodb_use_fallocate=ON,
    initialize pages_added = size - space->size so that posix_fallocate()
    will actually attempt to extend the file, instead of keeping the same size.

    This is a regression from MDEV-11556 which refactored
    the InnoDB data file extension.

    MDEV-12022 InnoDB wrongly ignores the end of an .ibd file

    InnoDB can wrongly ignore the end of data files when using
    innodb_page_size=32k or innodb_page_size=64k. These page sizes
    use an allocation extent size of 2 or 4 megabytes, not 1 megabyte.

    This issue does not affect MariaDB Server 10.2, which is using
    the correct WL#5757 code from MySQL 5.7.

    That said, it does not make sense to ignore the tail of data files.
    The next time the data file needs to be extended, it would be extended
    to a multiple of the extent size, once the size exceeds one extent.

    MDEV-11759: Encryption code in MariaDB 10.1/10.2 causes

    compatibility problems

    Pages that are encrypted contain post encryption checksum on
    different location that normal checksum fields. Therefore,
    we should before decryption check this checksum to avoid
    unencrypting corrupted pages. After decryption we can use
    traditional checksum check to detect if page is corrupted
    or unencryption was done using incorrect key.

    Pages that are page compressed do not contain any checksum,
    here we need to fist unencrypt, decompress and finally
    use tradional checksum check to detect page corruption
    or that we used incorrect key in unencryption.

    buf0buf.cc: buf_page_is_corrupted() mofified so that
    compressed pages are skipped.

    buf0buf.h, buf_block_init(), buf_page_init_low():
    removed unnecessary page_encrypted, page_compressed,
    stored_checksum, valculated_checksum fields from
    buf_page_t

    buf_page_get_gen(): use new buf_page_check_corrupt() function
    to detect corrupted pages.

    buf_page_check_corrupt(): If page was not yet decrypted
    check if post encryption checksum still matches.
    If page is not anymore encrypted, use buf_page_is_corrupted()
    traditional checksum method.

    If page is detected as corrupted and it is not encrypted
    we print corruption message to error log.
    If page is still encrypted or it was encrypted and now
    corrupted, we will print message that page is
    encrypted to error log.

    buf_page_io_complete(): use new buf_page_check_corrupt()
    function to detect corrupted pages.

    buf_page_decrypt_after_read(): Verify post encryption
    checksum before tring to decrypt.

    fil0crypt.cc: fil_encrypt_buf() verify post encryption
    checksum and ind fil_space_decrypt() return true
    if we really decrypted the page.

    fil_space_verify_crypt_checksum(): rewrite to use
    the method used when calculating post encryption
    checksum. We also check if post encryption checksum
    matches that traditional checksum check does not
    match.

    fil0fil.ic: Add missed page type encrypted and page
    compressed to fil_get_page_type_name()

    Note that this change does not yet fix innochecksum tool,
    that will be done in separate MDEV.

    Fix test failures caused by buf page corruption injection.

    MDEV-10812 WSREP causes responses being sent to protocol commands
    that must not send a response

    Problem:- When using wsrep (w/ galera) and issuing commands that can
    cause deadlocks, deadlock exception errors are sent in responses to
    commands such as close prepared statement and close connection which,
    by spec, must not send a response.

    Solution:- In dispatch_command, we will handle COM_QUIT and COM_STMT_CLOSE
    commands even in case of error.

    mysql_install_db enhancements to facilitate Debian bug#848616 fix

    In Debian, the default install is made more secure by omitting the anonymous
    user and by making the root account authenticate by unix socket
    authentication instead of the default password-less root. However, Debian
    hard-codes this change in mysql_install_db, which breaks that program for
    other users.

    This commit instead implements new general options for mysql_install_db that
    can be used by anyone to similarly perform a more secure install:

      --skip-auth-anonymous-user: omits the anonymous user.

      --auth-root-authentication-method=normal: Keeps the existing behaviour
        with a password-less root account. Currently on by default.

      --auth-root-socket-user=USER
      --auth-root-authentication-method=socket: creates the MariaDB root user
        with the name USER (defaults to 'root') and using unix socket
        authentication. This way, only that user has MariaDB root access
        after install.

    The idea with --auth-root-authentication-method=normal is that
    applications that need this behaviour can give that option explicitly.
    Then eventually we could make --auth-root-authentication-method=socket
    the default, giving a more secure default installation.

    Note that it is perfectly possible to do a secure install with
    --auth-root-authentication-method=normal. For example, installing a
    private server just for local access by a single OS-level user, by
    using --skip-networking and putting the connection socket in a
    location without public access. So it is important to preserve this
    API for backwards compatibility.

    MDEV-11623 MariaDB 10.1 fails to start datadir created with
    MariaDB 10.0/MySQL 5.6 using innodb-page-size!=16K

    The storage format of FSP_SPACE_FLAGS was accidentally broken
    already in MariaDB 10.1.0. This fix is bringing the format in
    line with other MySQL and MariaDB release series.

    Please refer to the comments that were added to fsp0fsp.h
    for details.

    This is an INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE that affects users of
    page_compression and non-default innodb_page_size. Upgrading
    to this release will correct the flags in the data files.
    If you want to downgrade to earlier MariaDB 10.1.x, please refer
    to the test innodb.101_compatibility how to reset the
    FSP_SPACE_FLAGS in the files.

    NOTE: MariaDB 10.1.0 to 10.1.20 can misinterpret
    uncompressed data files with innodb_page_size=4k or 64k as
    compressed innodb_page_size=16k files, and then probably fail
    when trying to access the pages. See the comments in the
    function fsp_flags_convert_from_101() for detailed analysis.

    Move PAGE_COMPRESSION to FSP_SPACE_FLAGS bit position 16.
    In this way, compressed innodb_page_size=16k tablespaces will not
    be mistaken for uncompressed ones by MariaDB 10.1.0 to 10.1.20.

    Derive PAGE_COMPRESSION_LEVEL, ATOMIC_WRITES and DATA_DIR from the
    dict_table_t::flags when the table is available, in
    fil_space_for_table_exists_in_mem() or fil_open_single_table_tablespace().
    During crash recovery, fil_load_single_table_tablespace() will use
    innodb_compression_level for the PAGE_COMPRESSION_LEVEL.

    FSP_FLAGS_MEM_MASK: A bitmap of the memory-only fil_space_t::flags
    that are not to be written to FSP_SPACE_FLAGS. Currently, these will
    include PAGE_COMPRESSION_LEVEL, ATOMIC_WRITES and DATA_DIR.

    Introduce the macro FSP_FLAGS_PAGE_SSIZE(). We only support
    one innodb_page_size for the whole instance.

    When creating a dummy tablespace for the redo log, use
    fil_space_t::flags=0. The flags are never written to the redo log files.

    Remove many FSP_FLAGS_SET_ macros.

    dict_tf_verify_flags(): Remove. This is basically only duplicating
    the logic of dict_tf_to_fsp_flags(), used in a debug assertion.

    fil_space_t::mark: Remove. This flag was not used for anything.

    fil_space_for_table_exists_in_mem(): Remove the unnecessary parameter
    mark_space, and add a parameter for table flags. Check that
    fil_space_t::flags match the table flags, and adjust the (memory-only)
    flags based on the table flags.

    fil_node_open_file(): Remove some redundant or unreachable conditions,
    do not use stderr for output, and avoid unnecessary server aborts.

    fil_user_tablespace_restore_page(): Convert the flags, so that the
    correct page_size will be used when restoring a page from the
    doublewrite buffer.

    fil_space_get_page_compressed(), fsp_flags_is_page_compressed(): Remove.
    It suffices to have fil_space_is_page_compressed().

    FSP_FLAGS_WIDTH_DATA_DIR, FSP_FLAGS_WIDTH_PAGE_COMPRESSION_LEVEL,
    FSP_FLAGS_WIDTH_ATOMIC_WRITES: Remove, because these flags do not
    exist in the FSP_SPACE_FLAGS but only in memory.

    fsp_flags_try_adjust(): New function, to adjust the FSP_SPACE_FLAGS
    in page 0. Called by fil_open_single_table_tablespace(),
    fil_space_for_table_exists_in_mem(), innobase_start_or_create_for_mysql()
    except if --innodb-read-only is active.

    fsp_flags_is_valid(ulint): Reimplement from the scratch, with
    accurate comments. Do not display any details of detected
    inconsistencies, because the output could be confusing when
    dealing with MariaDB 10.1.x data files.

    fsp_flags_convert_from_101(ulint): Convert flags from buggy
    MariaDB 10.1.x format, or return ULINT_UNDEFINED if the flags
    cannot be in MariaDB 10.1.x format.

    fsp_flags_match(): Check the flags when probing files.
    Implemented based on fsp_flags_is_valid()
    and fsp_flags_convert_from_101().

    dict_check_tablespaces_and_store_max_id(): Do not access the
    page after committing the mini-transaction.

    IMPORT TABLESPACE fixes:

    AbstractCallback::init(): Convert the flags.

    FetchIndexRootPages::operator(): Check that the tablespace flags match the
    table flags. Do not attempt to convert tablespace flags to table flags,
    because the conversion would necessarily be lossy.

    PageConverter::update_header(): Write back the correct flags.
    This takes care of the flags in IMPORT TABLESPACE.

    MDEV-11638 Encryption causes race conditions in InnoDB shutdown

    InnoDB shutdown failed to properly take fil_crypt_thread() into account.
    The encryption threads were signalled to shut down together with other
    non-critical tasks. This could be much too early in case of slow shutdown,
    which could need minutes to complete the purge. Furthermore, InnoDB
    failed to wait for the fil_crypt_thread() to actually exit before
    proceeding to the final steps of shutdown, causing the race conditions.

    Furthermore, the log_scrub_thread() was shut down way too early.
    Also it should remain until the SRV_SHUTDOWN_FLUSH_PHASE.

    fil_crypt_threads_end(): Remove. This would cause the threads to
    be terminated way too early.

    srv_buf_dump_thread_active, srv_dict_stats_thread_active,
    lock_sys->timeout_thread_active, log_scrub_thread_active,
    srv_monitor_active, srv_error_monitor_active: Remove a race condition
    between startup and shutdown, by setting these in the startup thread
    that creates threads, not in each created thread. In this way, once the
    flag is cleared, it will remain cleared during shutdown.

    srv_n_fil_crypt_threads_started, fil_crypt_threads_event: Declare in
    global rather than static scope.

    log_scrub_event, srv_log_scrub_thread_active, log_scrub_thread():
    Declare in static rather than global scope. Let these be created by
    log_init() and freed by log_shutdown().

    rotate_thread_t::should_shutdown(): Do not shut down before the
    SRV_SHUTDOWN_FLUSH_PHASE.

    srv_any_background_threads_are_active(): Remove. These checks now
    exist in logs_empty_and_mark_files_at_shutdown().

    logs_empty_and_mark_files_at_shutdown(): Shut down the threads in
    the proper order. Keep fil_crypt_thread() and log_scrub_thread() alive
    until SRV_SHUTDOWN_FLUSH_PHASE, and check that they actually terminate.

        Bug #24450908   UNDO LOG EXISTS AFTER SLOW SHUTDOWN

        Problem:
        ========

        1) cached undo segment is not removed from rollback segment history
        (RSEG_HISTORY) during slow shutdown. In other words, If the segment is
        not completely free, we are failing to remove an entry from the history
        list. While starting the server, we traverse all rollback segment slots
        history list and make it as list of undo logs to be purged in purge
        queue.
        In that case, purge queue will never be empty after slow shutdown.

        2) Freeing of undo log segment is linked with removing undo log header
        from history.

        Fix:
        ====
        1) Have separate logic of removing the undo log header from
        history list from rollback segment slots and remove it from
        rollback segment history even though it is not completely free.

    by the redo log, by invoking fil_space_set_recv_size().

    innobase_init(): Correct an error message, and do not require a larger

    size of the ibdata1 file if the autoextend attribute is set. Require

    MDEV-11656: 'Data structure corruption' IMPORT TABLESPACE doesn't work for encrypted InnoDB tables if space_id changed

    Problem was that for encryption we use temporary scratch area for
    reading and writing tablespace pages. But if page was not really
    decrypted the correct updated page was not moved to scratch area
    that was then written. This can happen e.g. for page 0 as it is
    newer encrypted even if encryption is enabled and as we write
    the contents of old page 0 to tablespace it contained naturally
    incorrect space_id that is then later noted and error message
    was written. Updated page with correct space_id was lost.

    If tablespace is encrypted we use additional
    temporary scratch area where pages are read
    for decrypting readptr == crypt_io_buffer != io_buffer.

    Destination for decryption is a buffer pool block
    block->frame == dst == io_buffer that is updated.
    Pages that did not require decryption even when
    tablespace is marked as encrypted are not copied
    instead block->frame is set to src == readptr.

    If tablespace was encrypted we copy updated page to
    writeptr != io_buffer. This fixes above bug.

    For encryption we again use temporary scratch area
    writeptr != io_buffer == dst
    that is then written to the tablespace

    (1) For normal tables src == dst ==  writeptr
    ut_ad(!encrypted && !page_compressed ?
    	src == dst && dst == writeptr + (i * size):1);
    (2) For page compressed tables src == dst == writeptr
    ut_ad(page_compressed && !encrypted ?
    	src == dst && dst == writeptr + (i * size):1);
    (3) For encrypted tables src != dst != writeptr
    ut_ad(encrypted ?
    	src != dst && dst != writeptr + (i * size):1);

    MDEV-9282 Debian: the Lintian complains about ""shlib-calls-exit"" in ha_innodb.so

    Replace all exit() calls in InnoDB with abort() [possibly via ut_a()].
    Calling exit() in a multi-threaded program is problematic also for
    the reason that other threads could see corrupted data structures
    while some data structures are being cleaned up by atexit() handlers
    or similar.

    In the long term, all these calls should be replaced with something
    that returns an error all the way up the call stack.

    MDEV-11636 Extra persistent columns on slave always gets NULL in RBR

    Problem:- In replication if slave has extra persistent column then these
    column are not computed while applying write-set from master.

    Solution:- While applying row events from server, we will generate values
    for extra persistent columns.

    Replication tests fail on valgrind due to waiting-related timeouts

    MTR raises default wait_for_pos_timeout from 300 to 1500 when tests
    are run with valgrind. The same needs to be done for other
    replication-related waits

    Fix some XML table type bugs:
    - in DOMNODELIST::DropItem
      if (Listp == NULL || Listp->length <= n)
        return true;
    is wrong, should be:
      if (Listp == NULL || Listp->length < n)
        return true;
    - Crash in discovery with libxml2 in XMLColumns because:
                if (!tdp->Usedom)    // nl was destroyed
                  vp->nl = vp->pn->GetChildElements(g);
    is executed with vp->pn uninitialized. Fixed by adding:
              vp->pn = node;
    line 264.
    -In discovery with libxml2 some columns are not found.
    Because list was not recovered properly, nodes being modified and not reallocated.
    Fixed lines 214 and 277.

    MDEV-10368: get_latest_version() called too often

    Reduce the number of calls to encryption_get_key_get_latest_version
    when doing key rotation with two different methods:

    (1) We need to fetch key information when tablespace not yet
    have a encryption information, invalid keys are handled now
    differently (see below). There was extra call to detect
    if key_id is not found on key rotation.

    (2) If key_id is not found from encryption plugin, do not
    try fetching new key_version for it as it will fail anyway.
    We store return value from encryption_get_key_get_latest_version
    call and if it returns ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION_INVALID there
    is no need to call it again.

    MDEV-11491 binlog_encryption.rpl_checksum fails sporadically in buildbot

    The race condition happened if mark_xid_done was considerably delayed,
    and an extra Binlog_checkpoint event was written into the binary log
    which was later indicated in an error message. Fixed by ensuring
    that the event is written before the binary log is rotated to the one
    which is used in the output.

    MDEV-11504 binlog_encryption.encrypted_master_switch_to_unencrypted fails sporadically in buildbot

    The reason is a simple race condition. Initially the test was meant to synchronize with master
    before showing tables, but it turned out that the slave IO thread should fail by this point,
    and synchronization was removed along with a server bugfix. Now added an intermediate sync
    instead, to make sure that slave has replicated events before the point of failure

    MDEV-11233 CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX with a token longer than 127 bytes
    crashes server

    This bug is the result of merging the Oracle MySQL follow-up fix
    BUG#22963169 MYSQL CRASHES ON CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX
    without merging the base bug fix:
    Bug#79475 Insert a token of 84 4-bytes chars into fts index causes
    server crash.

    Unlike the above mentioned fixes in MySQL, our fix will not change
    the storage format of fulltext indexes in InnoDB or XtraDB
    when a character encoding with mbmaxlen=2 or mbmaxlen=3
    and the length of a word is between 128 and 84*mbmaxlen bytes.
    The Oracle fix would allocate 2 length bytes for these cases.

    Compatibility with other MySQL and MariaDB releases is ensured by
    persisting the used maximum length in the SYS_COLUMNS table in the
    InnoDB data dictionary.

    This fix also removes some unnecessary strcmp() calls when checking
    for the legacy default collation my_charset_latin1
    (my_charset_latin1.name==""latin1_swedish_ci"").

    fts_create_one_index_table(): Store the actual length in bytes.
    This metadata will be written to the SYS_COLUMNS table.

    fts_zip_initialize(): Initialize only the first byte of the buffer.
    Actually the code should not even care about this first byte, because
    the length is set as 0.

    FTX_MAX_WORD_LEN: Define as HA_FT_MAXCHARLEN * 4 aka 336 bytes,
    not as 254 bytes.

    row_merge_create_fts_sort_index(): Set the actual maximum length of the
    column in bytes, similar to fts_create_one_index_table().

    row_merge_fts_doc_tokenize(): Remove the redundant parameter word_dtype.
    Use the actual maximum length of the column. Calculate the extra_size
    in the same way as row_merge_buf_encode() does.

          Problem:-
          The condition that checks for node readiness is too strict as it does
          not allow SELECTs even if these selects do not access any tables.
          For example,if we run

          OR
               SELECT @@max_allowed_packet;
          Solution:-

          is NULL:

    MDEV-11349 (2/2) Fix some bogus-looking Valgrind warnings

    buf_block_init(): Initialize buf_page_t::flush_type.
    For some reason, Valgrind 3.12.0 would seem to flag some
    bits in adjacent bitfields as uninitialized, even though only
    the two bits of flush_type were left uninitialized. Initialize
    the field to get rid of many warnings.

    buf_page_init_low(): Initialize buf_page_t::old.
    For some reason, Valgrind 3.12.0 would seem to flag all 32
    bits uninitialized when buf_page_init_for_read() invokes
    buf_LRU_add_block(bpage, TRUE). This would trigger bogus warnings
    for buf_page_t::freed_page_clock being uninitialized.
    (The V-bits would later claim that only ""old"" is initialized
    in the 32-bit word.) Perhaps recent compilers
    (GCC 6.2.1 and clang 4.0.0) generate more optimized x86_64 code
    for bitfield operations, confusing Valgrind?

    mach_write_to_1(), mach_write_to_2(), mach_write_to_3():
    Rewrite the assertions that ensure that the most significant
    bits are zero. Apparently, clang 4.0.0 would optimize expressions
    of the form ((n | 0xFF) <= 0x100) to (n <= 0x100). The redundant
    0xFF was added in the first place in order to suppress a
    Valgrind warning. (Valgrind would warn about comparing uninitialized
    values even in the case when the uninitialized bits do not affect
    the result of the comparison.)

    MDEV-11349 (1/2) Fix some clang 4.0 warnings

    In InnoDB and XtraDB functions that declare pointer parameters as nonnull,
    remove nullness checks, because GCC would optimize them away anyway.

    Use #ifdef instead of #if when checking for a configuration flag.

    Clang says that left shifts of negative values are undefined.
    So, use ~0U instead of ~0 in a number of macros.

    Some functions that were defined as UNIV_INLINE were declared as
    UNIV_INTERN. Consistently use the same type of linkage.

    ibuf_merge_or_delete_for_page() could pass bitmap_page=NULL to
    buf_page_print(), conflicting with the __attribute__((nonnull)).

    fix bogus stalls in the lock tree for low concurrency applications

    Merge into the MariaDB tree the pull request from Rich Prohaska for
    PerconaFT. These changes are needed to get parallel replication to
    work with TokuDB. Once the pull request is accepted by Percona and the new upstream version enters MariaDB, this commit can be superseded.

    Original commit message from Rich Prohaska:

        1. Fix the release before wait race

        The release before wait race occurs when a lock is released by transaction A after transaction B tried to acquire it but before transaction B has a chance to register it's pending lock request.  There are several ways to fix this problem, but we want to optimize for the common situation of minimal lock conflicts, which is what the lock acquisition algorithm currently does.  Our solution to the release before wait race is for transaction B to retry its lock request after its lock request has been added to the pending lock set.

        2. Fix the retry race

        The retry race occurs in the current lock retry algorithm which assumes that if some transaction is running lock retry, then my transaction does not also need to run it.  There is a chance that some pending lock requests will be skipped, but these lock requests will eventually time out.  For applications with small numbers of concurrent transactions, timeouts will frequently occur, and the application throughput will be very small.

        The solution to the retry race is to use a group retry algorithm.  All threads run through the retry logic.  Sequence numbers are used to group retries into batches such that one transaction can run the retry logic on behalf of several transactions.  This amortizes the retry cost.  The sequence numbers also ensure that when a transaction releases its locks, all of the pending lock requests that it is blocking are retried.

        3. Implement a mechanism to find and kill a pending lock request

        Tags lock requests with a client id, use the client id as a key into the pending lock requests sets to find a lock request, complete the lock request with a lock timeout error.

    AWS Key management plugin does not build on Centos7.

    Building AWS C++ SDK as external project needs CMake 2.8.12
    Centos7  out of the box has 2.8.11, thus the build fails.

    MDEV-11182: InnoDB: Assertion failure in file buf0buf.cc line 4730 (encryption.create_or_replace fails in buildbot and outside)

    Analysis: Problem is that page is encrypted but encryption information
    on page 0 has already being changed.

    Fix: If page header contains key_version != 0 and even if based on
    current encryption information tablespace is not encrypted we
    need to check is page corrupted. If it is not, then we know that
    page is not encrypted. If page is corrupted, we need to try to
    decrypt it and then compare the stored and calculated checksums
    to see is page corrupted or not.

    MDEV-10977: [ERROR] InnoDB: Block in space_id 0 in file ibdata1 encrypted.
    MDEV-10394: Innodb system table space corrupted

    Analysis: After we have read the page in buf_page_io_complete try to
    find if the page is encrypted or corrupted. Encryption was determined
    by reading FIL_PAGE_FILE_FLUSH_LSN_OR_KEY_VERSION field from FIL-header
    as a key_version. However, this field is not always zero even when
    encryption is not used. Thus, incorrect key_version could lead situation where
    decryption is tried to page that is not encrypted.

    Fix: We still read key_version information from FIL_PAGE_FILE_FLUSH_LSN_OR_KEY_VERSION
    field but also check if tablespace has encryption information before trying
    encrypt the page.

    Prepare XtraDB to be used with xtrabackup.

    The changes are deliberately kept minimal

    - some functions are made global instead of static (they will be used in
    xtrabackup later on)

    - functions got additional parameter, deliberately unused for now :
      fil_load_single_tablespaces
      srv_undo_tablespaces_init

    - Global variables added, also unused for now :
       srv_archive_recovery
       srv_archive_recovery_limit_lsn
       srv_apply_log_only
       srv_backup_mode
       srv_close_files

    - To make xtrabackup link with sql.lib on Windows, added some missing
      source files to sql.lib

    - Fixed os_thread_ret_t to be DWORD on Windows

    MDEV-11082 mysql_client_test: test_ps_query_cache fails with group-concat-max-len=1M

    test_bug14169 was setting session group_concat_max_len=1024 and
    did not clean it up. Because of that test_ps_query_cache, when run
    with group-concat-max-len != 1024, had different values in connections,
    and was inserting into query cache when a hit was expected.

    Fixed by adding a clean-up for the value in test_bug14169

    Merge ""remove unnecessary global mutex in parallel replication"" into 10.1.

commit 50f19ca8099994e992e1b411c7c05287855a7bdd
Author: Kristian Nielsen <knielsen@knielsen-hq.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 20 15:30:57 2016 +0200

    Remove unnecessary global mutex in parallel replication.

    The function apply_event_and_update_pos() is called with the
    rli->data_lock mutex held. However, there seems to be nothing in the
    function actually needing the mutex to be held. Certainly not in the
    parallel replication case, where sql_slave_skip_counter is always 0
    since the non-zero case is handled by the SQL driver thread.

    So this patch makes parallel replication use a variant of
    apply_event_and_update_pos() without the need to take the
    rli->data_lock mutex. This avoids one contended global mutex for each
    event executed, which might improve performance on CPU-bound workloads
    somewhat.

    MDEV-9416: MariaDB galera got signal 11 when altering table add unique index

    When a BF thread attempts to abort a victim thread's transaction,
    the victim thread is not locked and thus its not safe to rely on
    its data structures like htons registered for the trx.

    So, instead of getting the registered htons from victim, innodb's
    hton can be looked up directly from installed_htons[] and used to
    abort the transaction. (Same technique is used in older versions)

    Make sure to recompile the feedback plugin for EMBEDDED

    On OS X with clang 7.3.0 running any test as embedded crashes. As
    libfeedback was not compiled with embedded, we had 2 notions of THD,
    with different number of members. When calling inline functions defined in
    sql_class.h, the functions were defined for 1 THD but called on an
    object that is different. This resulted in erroneous data being returned
    and shortly after, a crash within the alloc_query() function.

    Recompile the feedback plugin for the embedded server specifically to
    not have such symbol conflicts.

    MDEV-10823  Certain unicode characters in hostname prevent mysqld from starting

    Server uses gethostname() for the default base name for pid/log files.
    If a character is not representable in current ANSI encoding, gethostname
    replaces it with question mark. Thus, generated log file name would also
    contain a question mark. However, Windows forbids certain characters in
    filenames, among them '?'.

    This is described in MSDN article https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx
    At attempts to create the file via freopen() fails, thus server would not
    be able to start.

    The fix is to verify hostname and fall back to  ""mysql"", if
    invalid characters are found.

    MDEV-9931: InnoDB reads first page of every .ibd file at startup

    Analysis: By design InnoDB was reading first page of every .ibd file
    at startup to find out is tablespace encrypted or not. This is
    because tablespace could have been encrypted always, not
    encrypted newer or encrypted based on configuration and this
    information can be find realible only from first page of .ibd file.

    Fix: Do not read first page of every .ibd file at startup. Instead
    whenever tablespace is first time accedded we will read the first
    page to find necessary information about tablespace encryption
    status.

    TODO: Add support for SYS_TABLEOPTIONS where all table options
    encryption information included will be stored.

    MDEV-10850 Wrong result for WHERE .. (f2=TO_BASE64('test') OR f2=TO_BASE64('TEST'))

    Problem N1: MDEV-10425
    Item_func_{md5|sha|sha2}::fix_length_and_dec() changed args[0]->collation
    to force binary comparison in args[0]->eq().
    It was done to treat e.g. MD5('a') and MD5('A') as different values.
    It is wrong for a Item_func_xxx to modify its arguments.
    Item_func_conv_charset did not expect that and crashed on assert.

    Problem N2: MDEV-10850
    Item_func_to_base64, Item_func_password, Item_func_hex are also case sensitive
    hash functions, but they did not compare their arguments as binary.

    Solution:
    - Removing the code changing args[0]->collation
    - Introducing Item_str_ascii_checksum_func as a common parent
      for Item_func_{md5|sha|sha2|password|hex|to_base64}
      and overriding its eq() method to compare arguments binary.

    Parallel replication async deadlock kill

    When a deadlock kill is detected inside the storage engine, the kill
    is not done immediately, to avoid calling back into the storage engine
    kill_query method with various lock subsystem mutexes held. Instead the
    kill is queued and done later by a slave background thread.

    This patch in preparation for fixing TokuDB optimistic parallel
    replication, as well as for removing locking hacks in InnoDB/XtraDB in
    10.2.

    MDEV-9423: cannot add new node to the cluser: Binlog..

    .. file '/var/log/mysql/mariadb-bin.000001' not found in binlog
    index, needed for recovery. Aborting.

    In Galera cluster, while preparing for rsync/xtrabackup based
    SST, the donor node takes an FTWRL followed by (REFRESH_ENGINE_LOG
    in rsync based state transfer and) REFRESH_BINARY_LOG. The latter
    rotates the binary log and logs Binlog_checkpoint_log_event
    corresponding to the penultimate binary log file into the new file.
    The checkpoint event for the current file is later logged
    synchronously by binlog_background_thread.

    Now, since in rsync/xtrabackup based snapshot state transfer methods,
    only the last binary log file is transferred to the joiner node; the
    file could get transferred even before the checkpoint event for the
    same file gets written to it. As a result, the joiner node would fail
    to start complaining about the missing binlog file needed for recovery.

    In order to fix this, a mechanism has been put in place to make
    REFRESH_BINARY_LOG operation wait for Binlog_checkpoint_log_event
    to be logged for the current binary log file if the node is part of
    a Galera cluster. As further safety, during rsync based state transfer
    the donor node now acquires and owns LOCK_log for the duration of file
    transfer during SST.

    MW-286 Avoid spurious deadlock errors when wsrep_on is disabled

    If a conflict happens under wsrep_on, the THD's wsrep_conflict_state
    is typically set to MUST_ABORT and cleared later, when transaction is
    aborted. However, when wsrep_on is disabled, no check is performed to
    see whether wsrep_conflict_state is set. So this potentially creates
    spurious deadlock errors on the subsequent statement that runs with
    wsrep_on enabled.
    To avoid this problem wsrep_thd_set_conflict_state() sets the conflict
    state only if wsrep_on is enabled.

    MW-292 Reset timestamp after transaction replay

    Transaction replay causes the THD to re-apply the replication
    events from execution, using the same path appliers do. While
    applying the log events, the THD's timestamp is set to the
    timestamp of the event.
    Setting the timestamp explicitly causes function NOW() to
    always the timestamp that was set. To avoid this behavior we
    reset the timestamp after replaying is done.

    The problem was caused by a merged semi-join, which contained a non-merged

    When moving non-merged semi-join from the subquery to its parent, do not
    forget to call fix_after_pullout for its Item_subselect. We need to do
    that specifically, because non-merged semi-joins do not have their
    IN-equality in the WHERE clause at this stage.

    This changes variable wsrep_max_ws_size so that its value
    is linked to the value of provider option repl.max_ws_size.
    That is, changing the value of variable wsrep_max_ws_size
    will change the value of provider option repl.max_ws_size,
    and viceversa.
    The writeset size limit is always enforced in the provider,
    regardless of which option is used.

    MDEV-10360: Extended keys: index properties depend on index order

    TABLE_SHARE::init_from_binary_frm_image has a rule: if an index
    has a partially-covered column (like in ""KEY(col(N))"" ), then dont
    provide ""Extended Keys"" feature for this index.

    The problem was that due to coding error Extended Keys feature was
    disabled for *ALL* subsequent indexes. Fixed the error.

    MDEV-9363 - Mroonga tests with datetime field fail on Solaris in buildbot

    On Solaris mktime() adds one extra day to tm_mday field and returns appropriate
    value for dates 1600-01-01 and earlier. That is 1600-01-01 becomes 1600-01-02.

    Solaris mktime manual excerpts:
      ...
      The tm_year member must be for year 1901 or later.  Calendar
      times  before  20:45:52  UTC,  December  13,  1901  or after
      03:14:07 UTC,  January 19, 2038 cannot be represented. Port-
      able  applications  should  not  try  to create dates before
      00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970 or after 00:00:00 UTC, January
      1, 2038.
      ...
      The  mktime() function assumes Gregorian dates. Times before
      the  adoption  of the Gregorian calendar will not match his-
      torial records.
      ...

    According to manual Mroonga only supports dates and datetimes after 1900:
    https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/about-mroonga/

    Technically these tests cover unsupported values and should fail on all
    platforms. Disable tests until the problem is fixed upstream.

    MDEV-10324: Server crash in get_sel_arg_for_keypart or Assertion

    The crash was caused by this problem:
    get_best_group_min_max() tries to construct query plans for keys that
    are not processed by the range optimizer. This wasn't a problem as long
    as SEL_TREE::keys was an array of MAX_KEY elements.
    However, now it is a Mem_root_array and only has elements for the used
    keys, and get_best_group_min_max attempts to address beyond the end of
    the array.

    The obvious way to fix the crash was to port (and improve) a part of
    96fcfcbd7b5120e8f64fd45985001eca8d36fbfb from mysql-5.7. This makes
    get_best_group_min_max not to consider indexes that Mem_root_arrays
    have no element for.

    After that, I got non-sensical query plans (see MDEV-10325 for details).
    Fixed that by making get_best_group_min_max to check if the index is in
    table->keys_in_use_for_group_by bitmap.

    MDEV-9423: cannot add new node to the cluser: Binlog..

    .. file '/var/log/mysql/mariadb-bin.000001' not found in binlog
    index, needed for recovery. Aborting.

    In Galera cluster, while preparing for rsync/xtrabackup based
    SST, the donor node takes an FTWRL followed by (REFRESH_ENGINE_LOG
    in rsync based state transfer and) REFRESH_BINARY_LOG. The latter
    rotates the binary log and logs Binlog_checkpoint_log_event
    corresponding to the penultimate binary log file into the new file.
    The checkpoint event for the current file is later logged
    synchronously by binlog_background_thread.

    Now, since in rsync/xtrabackup based snapshot state transfer methods,
    only the last binary log file is transferred to the joiner node; the
    file could get transferred even before the checkpoint event for the
    same file gets written to it. As a result, the joiner node would fail
    to start complaining about the missing binlog file needed for recovery.

    In order to fix this, a mechanism has been put in place to make
    REFRESH_BINARY_LOG operation wait for Binlog_checkpoint_log_event
    to be logged for the current binary log file if the node is part of
    a Galera cluster. As further safety, during rsync based state transfer
    the donor node now acquires and owns LOCK_log for the duration of file
    transfer during SST.

    Use hostname instead of IP in donor's socat

    Using IP address in donor's socat with TLS/SSL and certificate
    which doesn't contain IP address in CN or SubjectAltName causes
    transfer to fail with message:

    socat[5799] E certificate is valid but its commonName does not
    match hostname.

    This patch tries to reverse resolve IP address to hostname and
    use it for transfer. If reverse resolution fails, IP address is
    still used as fall-back, so proper A/AAAA and PTR records are
    important, but not mandatory.

    Certain certificates cannot contain IP addresses, e.g. FreeIPA's
    Dogtag doesn't allow it, so in my case I would need to use self-
    signed certificates instead, use verify=0 with socat or don't use
    TLS/SSL at all. Issue is mentioned in MDEV-9403.

    MDEV-10161: wsrep_sync_wait not enabled when set to 1 in config file

    Since wsrep_sync_wait & wsrep_causal_reads variables are related,
    they are always kept in sync whenever one of them changes.
    Same is tried on server start, where wsrep_sync_wait get updated
    based on wsrep_causal_reads' value. But, since wsrep_causal_reads
    is OFF by default, wsrep_sync_wait's value gets modified and loses
    its WSREP_SYNC_WAIT_BEFORE_READ bit.

    Fixed by syncing wsrep_sync_wait & wsrep_causal_reads values
    individually on server start in mysqld_get_one_option() based
    on command line arguments used.

    MDEV-10235: Deadlock in CREATE TABLE .. AS SELECT .. if result set is empty in Galera

    In CTAS, handlers get registered under statement transaction
    (st_transactions::stmt), while ha_fake_trx_id(), used by CTAS,
    looked under standard transaction (st_transactions::all) for
    registered handlers, and thus it failed to grab a fake transaction
    ID. As a result, with no valid transaction ID, wsrep commit failed
    with an error.

    ha_fake_trx_id() now looks for handlers registered under 'stmt'
    in case 'all' is empty. Also modified the logic to print warning
    only once if none of the registered handlers have fake_trx_id.

    MDEV-10186: mysqld crash when runtime setting wsrep_cluster_address without wsrep_on=ON

    On wsrep_cluster_address update, node restarts the replication
    and attempts to connect to the new address. In this process it
    makes a call to wsrep provider's connect API, which could lead
    to segfault if wsrep provider is not loaded (wsrep_on=OFF).

    Fixed by making sure that it proceeds only if a provider is
    loaded.

    MDEV-10004: Galera's pc.recovery process fails in 10.1 with systemd

    Galera recovery process works in two phases. In the first
    phase, mysqld is started as non-daemon with --wsrep-recover
    to recover and fetch the last logged global transaction ID.
    This ID is then used in second phase as the start position
    (--wsrep-start-position=XX) to start mysqld as daemon.

    As this process was implemented in mysqld_safe script, the
    recovery did not work when server was started using systemd.

    Fixed by introducing a shell script (wsrep_recovery.sh) that
    mimics the first phase of the recovery process.

    On Windows with low precision  (10-16 ms) timer used for timing queries,
    the statement ""set @@long_query_time=0.01"" can log itself a slow if it
    spawn more single timer tick.

    The fix is to filter this query out  from ""SELECT FROM mysql.slow_log""
    results

    MDEV-9764: MariaDB does not limit memory used for range optimization

    Part #2: make tree_or(tree1, tree2) to reuse tree1 for the result object
    for simple cases. These include key IN (c1, ... cN).

    The reuse was happening in old MySQL versions, but we stopped doing it
    in the ""fair choice between range and index_merge"" patch.

    MDEV-9764: MariaDB does not limit memory used for range optimization

    A partial backport of 67f21fb3a077dedfd14b9ca720e926c55e682f93,
    Bug#22283790: RANGE OPTIMIZER UTILIZES TOO MUCH MEMORY WITH MANY OR CONDITIONS

    The backported part changes SEL_TREE::keys from being an array of
    MAX_KEY elements (64*8=512 bytes) to a Mem_root_array<SEL_ARG*> (32 bytes +
    alloc'ed array of as many elements as we need).

    The patch doesn't fix the ""not limiting memory"" part, but the memory usage
    is much lower with it.

    MDEV-8989: ORDER BY optimizer ignores equality propagation

    Variant #4 of the fix.

    Make ORDER BY optimization functions take into account multiple
    equalities. This is done in several places:
    - remove_const() checks whether we can sort the first table in the
      join, or we need to put rows into temp.table and then sort.
    - test_if_order_by_key() checks whether there are indexes that
      can be used to produce the required ordering
    - make_unireg_sortorder() constructs sort criteria for filesort.

    function may have already set TABLE::dep_tables according to the outer

    INNODB: ""DATA DIRECTORY"" OPTION OF CREATE TABLE FAILS WITH PWRITE() OS
    ERROR 22
    Fix for version mysql-5.6
    PROBLEM
    ========
    For version mysql-5.6.27 onwards InnoDB fails to create a table
    with explicit 'data directory' option when Innodb_flush_method
    is set to O_DIRECT.While creating link file we get a  a pwrite
    error 22 due to the alignment restrictions imposed by O_DIRECT
    flag  which is being set for the link file created.

    FIX
    ===
    Fixed the above issue by making use of file IO functions while
    creating the link file that wouldn't let the O_DIRECT flag
    restrictions arise.

    MDEV-9171: innodb.innodb_uninstall Test Failure

    An additional warning saying ""tc-log cannot be enabled""
    is emitted when InnoDB is installed at runtime on mysqld
    built with wsrep-patch (-DWITH_WSREP=ON).

    This happens because, installing InnoDB increments the
    total number of 2pc-capable engines and with wsrep-patch
    already enabled - the total count goes >1. Even though,
    this condition is sufficient to enable tc-logging, it is
    not permitted at runtime, and thus the warning.

    Updated the testcase to avoid the warning.

    MDEV-9712 Performance degradation of nested NULLIF

    10.1 introduced a problem:
    Execution time for various recursive stages
    (walk, update_used_table, and propagate_equal_fields)
    in NULLIF is O(recursion_level^2), because complexity is
    doubled on every recursion level when we copy args[0] to args[2].

    This change fixes to avoid unnecessary recursion in:
    - Item_func_nullif::walk
    - Item_func_nullif::update_used_tables
    - Item_func_nullif::propagate_equal_fields
    when possible.

    MDEV-9949 Connect Engine: long SRCDEF leads to broken table

    Two bugs here:
    * the server could create an frm (with a long attribute
      value) that it could not read back
    * Connect engine opened files from inside DROP TABLE
      and was ignoring the error (correctly) but was not
      hiding it from the server (incorrectly). This caused
      a crash later when DROP TABLE was finishing successfully
      while stmt_da already have seen an error.

    Also added a text case for
      MDEV-7935 CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ... can cause a Server crash (Assertion `0' in Protocol::end_statement)
    because Connect stopped clearing the error status
    in stmt_da as a fix for MDEV-7935

    again. Remote tablespace is tried to locate even in case
    when DATA_DIR flag is not set.

    cluster/commit/b3ee75949ed82b88f355ca2e26431350cc1c89ac]

    During SST, the receiver node creates .sst directory under
    datadir to process/prepare the received data and removes it
    at the end of the process. In case of error, this directory,
    however, was not removed, which later caused subsequent SSTs
    to fail. Fixed by removing this directory at the beginning
    of SST if it existed.

    MDEV-9383: Server fails to read master.info after upgrade 10.0 -> 10.1

    In some cases, MariaDB 10.0 could write a master.info file that was read
    incorrectly by 10.1 and could cause server to fail to start after an upgrade.

    (If writing a new master.info file that is shorter than the old, extra
    junk may remain at the end of the file. This is handled properly in
    10.1 with an END_MARKER line, but this line is not written by
    10.0. The fix here is to make 10.1 robust at reading the master.info
    files written by 10.0).

    Fix several things around reading master.info and read_mi_key_from_file():

     - read_mi_key_from_file() did not distinguish between a line with and
       without an eqals '=' sign.

     - If a line was empty, read_mi_key_from_file() would incorrectly return
       the key from the previous call.

     - An extra using_gtid=X line left-over by MariaDB 10.0 might incorrectly
       be read and overwrite the correct value.

     - Fix incorrect usage of strncmp() which should be strcmp().

     - Add test cases.

    MDEV-9840: Test encryption.innodb-log-encrypt-crash fails on buildbot

    Problem: We created more than 5 encryption keys for redo-logs.
    Idea was that we do not anymore create more than one encryption
    key for redo-logs but if existing checkpoint from earlier
    MariaDB contains more keys, we should read all of them.

    Fix: Add new encryption key to memory structure only if there
    currently has none or if we are reading checkpoint from the log.
    Checkpoint from older MariaDB version could contain more than
    one key.

    MDEV-8684: UT_RELAX_CPU on Power to non-empty expansion

    Using __ppc_get_timebase will translate to mfspr instruction
    The mfspr instruction will block FXU1 until complete but the other
    Pipelines are available for execution of instructions from other
    SMT threads on the same core.

    The latency time to read the timebase SPR is ~10 cycles.

    So any impact on other threads is limited other FXU1 only instructions
    (basically other mfspr/mtspr ops).

    MDEV-717 LP:1003679 - Wrong binlog order on concurrent DROP schema and CREATE function.

            The cause of the issue is when DROP DATABASE takes
            metadata lock and is in progress through it's
            execution, a concurrently running CREATE FUNCTION checks
            for the existence of database which it succeeds and then it
            waits on the metadata lock.  Once DROP DATABASE writes to
            BINLOG and finally releases the metadata lock on schema
            object, the CREATE FUNCTION waiting on metadata lock
            gets in it's code path and succeeds and writes to binlog.

    MDEV-9604 crash in Item::save_in_field with empty enum value

    1. Fixing Field_time::get_equal_const_item() to pass TIME_FUZZY_DATES
       and TIME_INVALID_DATES to get_time_with_conversion().
       This is needed to make the recursively called Item::get_date() return
       non-NULL values on garbage input. This makes Field_time::get_equal_const_item()
       work consistently with how Item::val_time_packed() works.

    2. Fixing Item::get_date() to return TIME'00:00:00' rather than
       DATE'0000-00-00' on empty or garbage input when:
       - TIME_FUZZY_DATES is enabled
       - The caller requested a TIME value (by passing TIME_TIME_ONLY).
       This is needed to avoid conversion of DATE'0000-00-00' to TIME
       in get_time_with_conversion(), which would erroneously try to subtract
       CURRENT_DATE from DATE'0000-00-00' and return TIME'-838:59:59' rather than
       the desired zero value TIME'00:00:00'.

       #1 and #2 fix these type of scripts to return one row with both
       MyISAM and InnoDB, with and without an index on t1.b:

         CREATE TABLE t1 (a ENUM('a'), b TIME, c INT, KEY(b));
         INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('','00:00:00',0);
         SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE b='';
         SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a=b;
         SELECT * FROM t1 IGNORE INDEX(b) WHERE b='';
         SELECT * FROM t1 IGNORE INDEX(b) WHERE a=b;

       Additionally, #1 and #2 fix the originally reported in MDEV-9604 crash
       in Item::save_in_field(), because now execution goes through a different
       path, so save_in_field() is called for a Item_time_literal instance
       (which is non-NULL) rather than a Item_cache_str instance (which could
       return NULL without setting null_value).

    3. Fixing Field_temporal::get_equal_const_item_datetime() to enable
       equal field propagation for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP in case of
       comparison (e.g. when ANY_SUBST), for symmetry with
       Field_newdate::get_equal_const_item(). This fixes a number of problems
       with empty set returned on comparison to empty/garbage input.
       Now all SELECT queries in this script return one row for MyISAM and InnoDB,
       with and without an index on t1.b:

         CREATE TABLE t1 (a ENUM('a'), b DATETIME, c INT, KEY(b));
         INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0);
         SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE b='';
         SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a=b;
         SELECT * FROM t1 IGNORE INDEX(b) WHERE b='';
         SELECT * FROM t1 IGNORE INDEX(b) WHERE a=b;

    MDEV-9401: wsrep_forced_binlog_format with binlog causes crash

    Some statements are always replicated in STATEMENT binlog format.
    So upon their execution, the current binlog format is temporarily
    switched to STATEMENT even though the session's format is different.
    This state, stored in THD's current_stmt_binlog_format, was getting
    incorrectly masked by wsrep_forced_binlog_format, causing assertions
    and unintended generation of row events.

    Backported galera.galera_forced_binlog_format and added a test
    specific to this case.

    MDEV-9422: Checksum errors on restart when killing busy instance that uses encrypted XtraDB tables

    Analysis:

    -- InnoDB has n (>0) redo-log files.
    -- In the first page of redo-log there is 2 checkpoint records on fixed location (checkpoint is not encrypted)
    -- On every checkpoint record there is up to 5 crypt_keys containing the keys used for encryption/decryption
    -- On crash recovery we read all checkpoints on every file
    -- Recovery starts by reading from the latest checkpoint forward
    -- Problem is that latest checkpoint might not always contain the key we need to decrypt all the
       redo-log blocks (see MDEV-9422 for one example)
    -- Furthermore, there is no way to identify is the log block corrupted or encrypted

    For example checkpoint can contain following keys :

    write chk: 4 [ chk key ]: [ 5 1 ] [ 4 1 ] [ 3 1 ] [ 2 1 ] [ 1 1 ]

    so over time we could have a checkpoint

    write chk: 13 [ chk key ]: [ 14 1 ] [ 13 1 ] [ 12 1 ] [ 11 1 ] [ 10 1 ]

    killall -9 mysqld causes crash recovery and on crash recovery we read as
    many checkpoints as there is log files, e.g.

    read [ chk key ]: [ 13 1 ] [ 12 1 ] [ 11 1 ] [ 10 1 ] [ 9 1 ]
    read [ chk key ]: [ 14 1 ] [ 13 1 ] [ 12 1 ] [ 11 1 ] [ 10 1 ] [ 9 1 ]

    This is problematic, as we could still scan log blocks e.g. from checkpoint 4 and we do
    not know anymore the correct key.

    CRYPT INFO: for checkpoint 14 search 4
    CRYPT INFO: for checkpoint 13 search 4
    CRYPT INFO: for checkpoint 12 search 4
    CRYPT INFO: for checkpoint 11 search 4
    CRYPT INFO: for checkpoint 10 search 4
    CRYPT INFO: for checkpoint 9 search 4 (NOTE: NOT FOUND)

    For every checkpoint, code generated a new encrypted key based on key
    from encryption plugin and random numbers. Only random numbers are
    stored on checkpoint.

    Fix: Generate only one key for every log file. If checkpoint contains only
    one key, use that key to encrypt/decrypt all log blocks. If checkpoint
    contains more than one key (this is case for databases created
    using MariaDB server version 10.1.0 - 10.1.12 if log encryption was
    used). If looked checkpoint_no is found from keys on checkpoint we use
    that key to decrypt the log block. For encryption we use always the
    first key. If the looked checkpoint_no is not found from keys on checkpoint
    we use the first key.

    Modified code also so that if log is not encrypted, we do not generate
    any empty keys. If we have a log block and no keys is found from
    checkpoint we assume that log block is unencrypted. Log corruption or
    missing keys is found by comparing log block checksums. If we have
    a keys but current log block checksum is correct we again assume
    log block to be unencrypted. This is because current implementation
    stores checksum only before encryption and new checksum after
    encryption but before disk write is not stored anywhere.

    - PXC#480: xtrabackup-v2 SST fails with multiple log_bin directives in my.cnf

      If any given variable the xtrabackup-v2 sst script looks for is specified
      multiple times in cnf file then it tend to pick both of them causing
      some of the follow-up command to fail.

      Avoid this programatic mistake by honoring only the last variable assigned
      setting as done by mysqld too.

    - PXC#460: wsrep_sst_auth don't work in Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-56-5.6.25-25.12.1.el7

    Semantics:
    ---------

    * Generally end-user will create a separate user with needed
    privileges for
        performing DONOR action.
    * This user credentials are specified using wsrep_sst_auth.

    * Along with this user there could be other user(s) created on the
    server
        that sysadmin may use for normal or other operations
    * Credentials for these user(s) can be specified in same
    cluster/server
        cnf file as part of [client] section

    When cluster act as DONOR and if wsrep_sst_auth is provided then it
    should
    strictly use it for performing SST based action.

    What if end-user has same credentials for performing both SST action
    and
    normal admin work ?
    * Then end-user can simply specify these credentials as part of
    [client]
        section in cnf file and skip providing wsrep_sst_auth.

    Issue:
    -----

    MySQL client user/password parsing preference order is as follows:
    * command line (through --user/--password)
    * cnf file
    * MYSQL_PWD enviornment variable.

    Recent change tried passing sst user password through MYSQL_PWD
    (and user though --user command line param as before).

    On the system where-in admin had another user for performing non-SST
    actions,
    credentials for such user were present in cnf file under [client]
    section.

    Due to mysql client preference order, SST user name was used (as it
    was
    passed through command line) but password of other user (meant for
    non-SST)
    action was being used as it was passed through cnf file.

    Password passed through MYSQL_PWD was completely ignored causing
    user-name/password mismatch.

    Solution:
    ---------

    * If user has specified credentials for SST then pass them through
    command
        line so that they are used in priority.

    (There could be security concern on passing things through command
    line but
       when I tried passing user-name and password through command line to
    mysql
       client and then did ps I saw this
       ./bin/mysql --user=sstuser --password=x xxxxxxxx -S /tmp/n1.sock
    so seems like password is not shown)

    The reason for the assertion failure is that the update statement for

    column.

    Make sure that triggers update the used columns accordingly, when being

    MDEV-9500 Bug after upgrade to 10.1.10 (and 10.1.11)

    Case: table with a NOT NULL field, BEFORE UPDATE trigger,
    and UPDATE with a subquery that uses GROUP BY on that
    NOT NULL field, and needs a temporary table for it.

    Because of the BEFORE trigger, the field becomes nullable
    temporarily. But its Item_field (used in GROUP BY) doesn't.
    When working with the temptable some code looked at
    item->maybe_null, some - at field->null_ptr.
    The fix: make Item_field nullable when its field is.

    This triggers an assert. The group key size is calculated
    before the item is made nullable, so the group key doesn't
    have a null byte. The fix: make fields/items nullable
    before the group key size is calculated.

      Query cache was invalidated too early, and allowed old
      entries to be inserted to the cache.

    - Reset thd->wsrep_sync_wait_gtid on query cache hit.
      THD->cleanup_after_query is not called in such cases,
      and thd->wsrep_sync_wait_gtid remained initialized.

    PXC-391: Avoid Total Order Isolation (TOI) for LOCAL sql admin commands.

    The admin commands in question are:
        > OPTIMIZE
        > REPAIR
        > ANALYZE

    For LOCAL or NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG invocations of these commands, ie

        OPTIMIZE LOCAL TABLE <t1>

    they are not binlogged as expected.

    Also, in addition, they are not executed under TOI.

    Hence, they are not propagated to other nodes.

    The effect is same as that of wsrep_on=0.

    Also added tests for this.

    A WSREP_DEBUG for wsrep_register_hton has also been added.

    The galera_flush_local test has also been updated for verifying that effects
    of  NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG / LOCAL are equivalent to wsrep_on=0 from wsrep
    perspective.

    - Fixes query cache so that it is aware of wsrep_sync_wait.
      Query cache would return (possibly stale) results to the

    Fixes a deadlock between applier and its victim transaction.
    The deadlock would manifest when a BF victim was waiting for some lock
    and was signaled to rollback, and the same time its wait
    timeout expired. In such cases the victim would return from
    lock_wait_suspend_thread() with error DB_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT, as opposed to
    DB_DEADLOCK. As a result only the last statement of the victim would rollback,
    and eventually it would deadlock with the applier.

    Secondly, if page decrypt is detected we should return false
    from buf_page_decrypt_after_read.

    MDEV-9504: ANALYZE TABLE shows wrong 'rows' value for ORDER BY query

    Revert the patch for MDEV-9504.
    It causes test failures, attempt to fix these causes more failures. The
    source of all this is that the code in test_if_skip_sort_order() has
    a peculiar way of treating select_limit parameter:
    Correct value is computed when the query plan is changed. In other cases,
    we use an approximation that ignores the presence of GROUP BY clause,
    or JOINs, or both.

    A patch that fixes all of the above would be too big to do in 10.1

    MDEV-9457: Poor query plan chosen for ORDER BY query by a recent 10.1

    Undo the change in test_if_skip_sort_order() that set ref_key=-1 when
    a variant of index_merge is used (was made in fix for MDEV-9021).

    It turned out that test_if_cheaper_ordering() call below assumes that
    ref_key=-1 means ""no index is used"", that is, ""an inefficient full table
    scan is done"".
    This is not the same as index_merge, index_merge can actually be quite
    efficient. So, ref_key=MAX_KEY denotes the fact that some index is used,
    not any given index.

    Changed code to comply to C90 standard.

    Fixed a crash during stacktrace printing if addr2line failed to start.

    In order to get all the input from addr2line we must read in a loop,
    until the response is complete. Also, in case that the response is
    malformed, we must not end up reading invalid memory.

    Fixed compilation failure on MacOSX

    Due to a hack that has propagated to the maria storage engine, undefined
    behaviour would result by bypassing the initialization code of variables
    after my_thread_init().

    By refactoring the nested logic into a separate function, this problem
    is resolved.

    MDEV-9128 - Compiling on IBM System Z fails

    Provided IBM System Z have outdated compiler version, which supports gcc sync
    builtins but not gcc atomic builtins. It also has weak memory model.

    InnoDB attempted to verify if __sync_lock_test_and_set() is available by
    checking IB_STRONG_MEMORY_MODEL. This macro has nothing to do with availability
    of __sync_lock_test_and_set(), the right one is HAVE_ATOMIC_BUILTINS.

    A deadlock can occur when the wsrep applier thread while

    order if their seqno comes after one assigned to FLUSH

    to be removed from table definition cache.

    MDEV-9183 MariaDB 10.1 crash on `mysqld --verbose --help`

    plugin_init() works like this:
    1. init MyISAM
    2. load plugins from mysql.plugin, if it's a MyISAM table
    3. init all not initialized plugins
    4. all done, if step 2 loaded mysql.plugin,
       otherwise:
    5. load plugins from mysql.plugin
    6. init all not initialized plugins

    now, with --help --verbose, step 3 will not actually
    initialize them, and if mysql.plugin is unreadable,
    step 6 will try to initialize existing plugins again.
    Fix: when skipping initialization because of --help,
    change plugin status from PLUGIN_IS_UNINITIALIZED.

    MDEV-9290 : InnoDB: Assertion failure in file trx0sys.cc line 353

    As a fix for MDEV-8208, for initial wsrep threads, the
    invocation of init_for_queries() was moved after plugins
    were initialized. Due to which, OPTION_BEGIN bit of wsrep
    applier THD (originally set in wsrep_replication_process)
    got reset due to implicit commit within init_for_queries().
    As a result, events from a multi-statement transaction from
    another node were committed separately by the applier thread,
    which leads to an assertion as they all carry same seqno.

    Fixed by making sure that variable.option_bits are restored
    post init_for_queries(). Also restored server_status.
    Added a test case.

    MDEV-9162 : MariaDB Galera Cluster memory leak on async slave node

    As galera node (slave) received query log events from an async
    replication master, it partially wrote the updates made to replication
    state table (mysql.gtid_slave_pos) to galera transaction writeset post
    TOI. As a result, the transaction handle, thus created within galera,
    was never freed/purged as the corresponding trx did not commit.
    Thus, it kept piling up for every query log event and was only reclaimed
    upon server shutdown when the transaction map object got destructed.
    Fixed by making sure that updates in replication slave state table
    are not written to galera transaction writeset and thus, not replicated
    to other nodes.

    MDEV-9033: Incorrect statements binlogged on slave with do_domain_ids=(...)

    Post-fix: The test case pushed with the fix had each node
    acting as slave to the other two nodes with different set
    of filters on server_id's. The slave's gtid_slave_pos is
    updated after it processes the events received from master
    nodes irrespective of whether the events were filtered
    or not. Thus, sync_with_master_gtid.inc could unblock even
    on filtered events.
    As a result, sync_with_master_gtid.inc would fail to block
    until the desired changes have been replicated.  Fixed by
    simplifying the topology.
    Also, modified CHANGE MASTER commands to ignore based
    on gtid_domain_id instead of server_id.

    MDEV-9128 - Compiling on IBM System Z fails

    Provided IBM System Z have outdated compiler version, which supports gcc sync
    builtins but not gcc atomic builtins. It also has weak memory model.

    InnoDB attempted to verify if __sync_lock_test_and_set() is available by
    checking IB_STRONG_MEMORY_MODEL. This macro has nothing to do with availability
    of __sync_lock_test_and_set(), the right one is HAVE_ATOMIC_BUILTINS.

    Post-merge fixes for Connect engine

    1. define connect_EXPORTS, this causes the engine to use MariaDB
       versions for timestamp<->struct tm conversion instead of
       TZ-dependent libc versions.
    2. remove check_access() that was removed once, but re-appeared
       during a complex merge.
    3. disable a totally broken test
    4. update test results
    5. skip odbc_firebird test when no firebird DSN is available

    Incorrect statements binlogged on slave with do_domain_ids=(...)

    In domain ID based filtering, a flag is used to filter-out
    the events that belong to a particular domain. This flag gets
    set when IO thread receives a GTID_EVENT for the domain on
    filter list and its reset at the last event in the GTID group.
    The resetting, however, was wrongly done before the decision to
    write/filter the event from relay log is made. As a result, the
    last event in the group will always pass through the filter.
    Fixed by deferring the reset logic. Also added a test case.

    MTR: rsync process is left running if pid file is removed

    MTR drops the datadir in the event of a test failure. In case mysqld
    is running as a Galera node and a failure occurs while the SST is in
    progress, the rsync pid file gets removed as part of the cleanup and
    wsrep_sst_rsync, which relies on this file, fails to kill the rsync.
    Fixed by using the cached $RSYNC_REAL_PID to kill rsync daemon.

    MDEV-9124 mysqldump does not dump data if table name is same as view earlier on

    While querying INFORMATION SCHEMA, check for a table's engine
    only used table name, but not schema name; so, if there were different
    rows with the same table name, a wrong one could be retrieved.
    The result of the check affected the decision whether the contents
    of the table should be dumped, and whether a DELAYED option can be used.
    Fixed by adding a clause for table_schema to the query.

    MDEV-9021: MYSQLD SEGFAULTS WHEN BUILT USING --WITH-MAX-INDEXES=128

    The bitmap implementation defines two template Bitmap classes. One
    optimized for 64-bit (default) wide bitmaps while the other is used for
    all other widths.

    In order to optimize the computations, Bitmap<64> class has defined its
    own member functions for bitmap operations, the other one, however,
    relies on mysys' bitmap implementation (mysys/my_bitmap.c).

    Issue 1:
    In case of non 64-bit Bitmap class, intersect() wrongly reset the
    received bitmap while initialising a new local bitmap structure
    (bitmap_init() clears the bitmap buffer) thus, the received bitmap was
    getting cleared.

    Fixed by initializing the local bitmap structure by using a temporary
    buffer and later copying the received bitmap to the initialised bitmap
    structure.

    Issue 2:
    The non 64-bit Bitmap class had the Iterator missing which caused
    compilation failure.

    Also added a cmake variable to hold the MAX_INDEXES value when supplied
    from the command prompt. (eg. cmake .. -DMAX_INDEXES=128U). Checks have
    been put in place to trigger build failure if MAX_INDEXES value is
    greater than 128.

    Test modifications:
    * Introduced include/have_max_indexes_[64|128].inc to facilitate
    skipping of tests for which the output differs with different
    MAX_INDEXES.

    * Introduced include/max_indexes.inc which would get modified by cmake
    to reflect the MAX_INDEXES value used to build the server. This file
    simply sets an mtr variable '$max_indexes' to show the MAX_INDEXES
    value, which will then be consumed by the above introduced include file.

    * Some tests (portions), dependent on MAX_INDEXES value, have been moved
    to separate test files.

    MDEV-9082 - Debian: mysql_install_db is called on upgrade

    A comment in debian/mariadb-server-10.1.postinst says: ""can safely run on
    upgrades with existing databases"". While this is true there're a few reasons not
    to do that:
    - it increases installation time (it has to run rather heavy mysqld multiple times)
    - as well as it increases mysqld downtime
    - it may fail if database has some plugin specific configs (see MDEV-8437)
    - there should be no need to run this script on upgrade: they should be handled
      by mysql_upgrade to
    - RPM postin doesn't call it if database directory exists

    Also postinst is not supposed to create database directories: let
    mysql_install_db do that intead.

    MDEV-9080 - Debian: incorrect empty password check in postinst

    There was code that was supposed to ""catch upgrades from previous versions where
    the root password wasn't set"". But it is wrong in many regards:
    - it is supposed to be executed against running server, but at this point server
      should be down, which makes this code no-op
    - if the above is fixed, root password will be requested twice (initial root
      password request + this one)
    - it asks for a password only once, while ""initial root password request"" asks
      twice (password + password verification)
    - it may give false positive if unix socket based authentication is in effect

    Removed this code since it didn't work for quite a while (at least since
    mysql-5.1) and nobody cared about it.

    MDEV-8437 - plugin variables conflict with bootstrap

    There is no strong need to change password column: the only side effect is
    that 4.0 -> 10.1 upgrades may get root/debian-sys-maint passwords stored in old
    format. This should be perfectly acceptable, since all password at this point
    are stored in old format.

    MDEV-8437 - plugin variables conflict with bootstrap

    Removed redundant attempt to create mysql.plugin table:
    - original code was supposed to INSTALL some plugins:
      INSERT INTO plugin VALUES ('innodb', 'ha_innodb.so'),
        ('federated', 'ha_federated.so'), ('blackhole', 'ha_blackhole.so'),
        ('archive', 'ha_archive.so');
    - original code was supposed to fail if mysql.plugin exists:
      The query sequence is supposed to be aborted if the CREATE TABLE fails due
      to an already existent table in which case the admin might already have
      chosen to remove one or more plugins.
    - mysql.plugin must've been created by preceeding mysql_install_db anyway

    MDEV-8975: 10.1 Fails To Join Existing Galera Cluster

    During the process of guessing the IP address, if bind-address
    is INADDR_ANY, mysqld should proceed with address specified via
    wsrep_node_address or use one from network interfaces.

    Patch contributed by darkain (pull#115).

    MDEV-9040: 10.1.8 fails after upgrade from 10.0.21

    Analysis: Lengths which are not UNIV_SQL_NULL, but bigger than the following
    number indicate that a field contains a reference to an externally
    stored part of the field in the tablespace. The length field then
    contains the sum of the following flag and the locally stored len.

    This was incorrectly set to

    define UNIV_EXTERN_STORAGE_FIELD (UNIV_SQL_NULL - UNIV_PAGE_SIZE_MAX)

    When it should be

    define UNIV_EXTERN_STORAGE_FIELD (UNIV_SQL_NULL - UNIV_PAGE_SIZE_DEF)

    Additionally, we need to disable support for > 16K page size for
    row compressed tables because a compressed page directory entry
    reserves 14 bits for the start offset and 2 bits for flags.
    This limits the uncompressed page size to 16k. To support
    larger pages page directory entry needs to be larger.

    MDEV-9026: Revert patch for MDEV-6069

    Post-fix:
    Reverting the patch for MDEV-6069 brought some ALTERs with
    ENGINE=MYISAM back into the mysql_system_tables_fix.sql
    script. As a result, running mysql_upgrade with global
    enforce_storage_engine=INNODB (or any other non-MyISAM
    engine, for that matter) would fail.

    Fixed by locally unsetting enforce_storage_engine in the
    upgrade script.

    MDEV-8738 Application Verifier stop during server shutdown

    The verifier exception is caused by using thread local storage key
    after key was deleted.

    my_free() used current_thd within malloc size callback, which does
    pthread_get_specific(THR_THD), but THR_THD is already deleted at this
    point.

    The fix moves pthread_key_delete() to a later point in shutdown.

    MDEV-8869: Potential lock_sys->mutex deadlock

    Analysis: We are alreading holing lock_sys mutex when we call thd::awake.
    This could lead mutex deadlock if trx->current_lock_mutex_owner is not
    correctly set.

    Fix: Make sure that trx->current_lock_mutex_owner is correctly set.

    MDEV-426: systemd PermissionsStartOnly=true by default

    mariadb-service-convert during migration can create a file containing
    ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/sysctl -q -w vm.drop_caches=3 if the users my.cnf
    contains [mysqld_safe] flush_caches. This sysctl entry change requires root
    access. No existing ExecStartPre requires execution requires execution
    as another user.

    There is a comment in the mariadb{,@}.service.in that indicates
    mysqld_install which would require -u mysql to explicity change user to
    mysql from root since PermissionsStartOnly=true.

    Otherwise the following error would be generated:

    by setting CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE. According to logics of recent CPackRPM
    it is not enough: one needs to set CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE additionally.

    MDEV-8087: Server crashed in Time_and_counter_tracker::incr_loops

    Problem:
    Procedure which uses stack of views first executed without most deep view.
    It fails but one view cached (as well as whole procedure).
    Then simultaniusely create the second view we lack and execute the procedure.
    In the beginning of procedure execution the view is not yet created so
    procedure used as it was cached (cache was not invalidated).
    But by the time we are trying to use most deep view it is already created.
    The problem with the view is that thd->select_number (first view was not parsed) so second view will get the same number.

    The fix is in keeping the thd->select_number correct even if we use cached views.
    In the proposed solution (to keep it simple) counter can be bigger then should but it should not create problem because numbers are still unique and situation is very rare.

    Less logging of not critial things during startup/shutdown:

    - Added --start option to mysqld which don't prints notes to log on startup
      This helps to find errors in configure options easier
    - Dont write [Note] entries to log after we have abort the server
      This makes it easier to find what went wrong
    - Don't by default write out Changed limits for max_open_files as this didn't really change from anything the user gave us
    - Dont write warnings about not using --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp (we don't have plans do depricate the old behaviour)

    MDEV-8918 Wrong result for CAST(AVG(bigint_column) AS SIGNED)

    - Moving Item_xxx_field declarations after Item_sum_xxx declarations,
      so Item_xxx_field constructors can be defined directly in item_sum.h
      rather than item_sum.cc. This removes some duplicate code, e.g.
      initialization of the following members at constructor time:
      name, decimals, max_length, unsigned_flag, field, maybe_null.
    - Adding Item_sum_field as a common parent for Item_avg_field and
      Item_variance_field
    - Deriving Item_sum_field directly from Item rather that Item_result_field,
      as Item_sum_field descendants do not need anything from Item_result_field.
    - Removing hybrid infrastructure from Item_avg_field,
      adding Item_avg_field_decimal and Item_avg_field_double instead,
      as desired result type is already known at constructor time
      (not only at fix_fields time). This simplifies the code.
    - Changing Item_avg_field_decimal::val_int() to call val_int_from_decimal()
      instead of doing { return (longlong) rint(val_real()); }
      This is the fix itself.

    Combined fix for MDEV-7267 and MDEV-8864

    The problem was that GROUP BY code created Item_field objects
    that referred to fields in the temp. tables used for GROUP BY.

    Item_ref and set_items_ref_array() call caused pointers to temp.
    table fields to occur in many places.

    This patch introduces Item_temptable_field, which can handle
    item->print() calls made after the underlying table is freed.

    remove unused group_by_handler::init() method

    The assumption is that the engine should not need to
    evaluate HAVING on the table->record[0] - the engine either
    can evaluate HAVING internally before writing it to the
    table->record[0], or it should leave it to the server,
    that will evaluate HAVING(table->record[0]).

    Similarly the engine should not need to evaluate ORDER
    on the table->record[0]. Either it returns the data already
    sorted, or the server will sort the table.

    MDEV-6080: Allowing storage engine to shortcut group by queries

    This task is to allow storage engines that can execute GROUP BY or
    summary queries efficiently to intercept a full query or sub query from
    MariaDB and deliver the result either to the client or to a temporary
    table for further processing.

    - Added code in sql_select.cc to intercept GROUP BY queries.
      Creation of group_by_handler is done after all optimizations to allow
      storage engine to benefit of an optimized WHERE clause and suggested
      indexes to use.
    - Added group by handler to sequence engine and a group_by test suite as
      a way to test the new interface.
    - Intercept EXPLAIN with a message ""Storage engine handles GROUP BY""

    libmysqld/CMakeLists.txt:
      Added new group_by_handler files
    sql/CMakeLists.txt:
      Added new group_by_handler files
    sql/group_by_handler.cc:
      Implementation of group_by_handler functions
    sql/group_by_handler.h:
      Definition of group_by_handler class
    sql/handler.h:
      Added handlerton function to create a group_by_handler, if the storage
      engine can intercept the query.
    sql/item_cmpfunc.cc:
      Allow one to evaluate item_equal any time.
    sql/sql_select.cc:
      Added code to intercept GROUP BY queries
      - If all tables are from the same storage engine and the query is
        using sum functions, call create_group_by() to check if the storage
        engine can intercept the query.
        - If yes:
           - create a temporary table to hold a GROUP_BY row or result
           - In do_select() intercept normal query execution by instead
             calling the group_by_handler to get the result
           - Intercept EXPLAIN
    sql/sql_select.h:
      Added handling of group_by_handler
      Added caching of the original join tab (needed for cleanup after
      group_by handler)
    storage/sequence/mysql-test/sequence/group_by.result:
      Test group_by_handler interface
    storage/sequence/mysql-test/sequence/group_by.test:
      Test group_by_handler interface
    storage/sequence/sequence.cc:
      Added simple group_by_engine for handling COUNT(*) and
      SUM(primary_key).  This was done as a test of the group_by_handler
      interface

      that have a reverse function and can use the range optimizer for
      to optimize ""value OP field"" as ""field REV_OP value"". Deriving
      Item_bool_rowready_func2 and Item_funt_spatial_rel from the new class.
    - Removing Item_bool_func2::have_rev_func().

    MDEV-8865 Wrong field type or metadata for COALESCE(signed_int_column, unsigned_int_column)
    Item_func_hybrid_field_type did not return correct field_type(), cmp_type()
    and result_type() in some cases, because cached_result_type and
    cached_field_type were set in independent pieces of the code and
    did not properly match to each other.
    Fix:
    - Removing Item_func_hybrid_result_type
    - Deriving Item_func_hybrid_field_type directly from Item_func
    - Introducing a new class Type_handler which guarantees that
      field_type(), cmp_type() and result_type() are always properly synchronized
      and using the new class in Item_func_hybrid_field_type.

    MDEV-8208: Sporadic SEGFAULT on startup

    Addendum:
    * Before calling THD::init_for_queries(), flip the current_thd to wsrep
    thread so that memory gets allocated for the right THD.
    * Use wsrep_creating_startup_threads instead of plugins_are_initialized
    as the condition for the execution of THD::init_for_queries() within
    start_wsrep_THD(), as use of latter could still leave some room for
    race.

    MDEV-8208: Sporadic SEGFAULT on startup

    Problem:
    When mysqld starts as a galera node, it creates 2 system threads
    (applier & rollbacker) using start_wsrep_THD(). These threads are
    created before plugin initialization (plugin_init()) for SST methods
    like rsync and xtrabackup.

    The threads' initialization itself can proceed in parallel to mysqld's
    main thread of execution. As a result, the thread initialization code
    (start_wsrep_THD()) can end up accessing some un/partially initialized
    structures (like maria_hton, in this particular case) resulting in
    segfault.

    Solution:
    Fixed by calling THD::init_for_queries() (which accesses maria_hton)
    only after the plugins have been initialized.

    MDEV-8253 EXPLAIN SELECT prints unexpected characters
    Item_string::clone_item() creates a new Item_string that
    points exactly to the same buffer that the original one does.
    Later, Item_string::print() uses c_ptr() for the original Item_string,
    which reallocs the original buffer, and the clone remain with
    the old freed buffer.
    Refactoring the code not to use c_ptr() in Item_string::print().

    Folloup: Made encryption rules too strict (and incorrect). Allow creating

    warning that nondefault values are ignored. Allow creating table with
    ENCRYPTED=DEFAULT if used key_id is found from key file (there was
    bug on this) and give error if key_id is not found.

    MDEV-8664 - plugins.show_all_plugins --embedded fails in buildbot

    Failed attempt to load dynamic library with STB_GNU_UNIQUE symbol may corrupt
    internal dynamic linker data sructures. This looks like libdl bug:
    https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14577

    In embedded mode ""show plugins soname"" fails to dlopen ha_mroonga.so (which
    has STB_GNU_UNIQUE) due to undefined reference to wsrep_forced_binlog_format.
    It crashes later in subsequent call to dlopen() from  pthread_exit().

    Disabled plugins.show_all_plugins until dlopen() bug is fixed.

    MDEV-8817: Failing assertion: new_state->key_version != ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION_INVALID

    Analysis: Problem sees to be the fact that we allow creating or altering
    table to use encryption_key_id that does not exists in case where
    original table is not encrypted currently. Secondly we should not
    do key rotation to tables that are not encrypted or tablespaces
    that can't be found from tablespace cache.

    Fix: Do not allow creating unencrypted table with nondefault encryption key
    and do not rotate tablespaces that are not encrypted (FIL_SPACE_ENCRYPTION_OFF)
    or can't be found from tablespace cache.

    MDEV-8779: mysqld got signal 11 in sql/opt_range_mrr.cc:100(step_down_to)

    The crash was caused by range optimizer using RANGE_OPT_PARAM::min_key
    (and max_key) to store keys. Buffer size was a good upper bound for
    range analysis and partition pruning, but not for EITS selectivity
    calculations.

    Fixed by making these buffers variable-size. The sizes are calculated
    from [pseudo]indexes used for range analysis.

    MDEV-8816 Equal field propagation is not applied for WHERE varbinary_column>=_utf8'a' COLLATE utf8_general_ci AND varbinary_column='A';
    1. Removing the legacy code that disabled equal field propagation in cases
       when comparison is done as VARBINARY. This is now correctly handled by
       the new propagation code in Item_xxx::propagate_equal_fields() and
       Field_str::can_be_substituted_to_equal_item (the bug fix).
    2. Also, removing legacy (pre-MySQL-4.1) Arg_comparator methods
       compare_binary_string() and compare_e_binary_string(), as VARBINARY
       comparison is correcty handled in compare_string() and compare_e_string() by
       the corresponding VARBINARY collation handler implemented in my_charset_bin.
       (not really a part of the bug fix)

    MDEV-8208: Sporadic SEGFAULT on startup

    Problem:
    When mysqld starts as a galera node, it creates 2 system threads
    (applier & rollbacker) using start_wsrep_THD(). These threads are
    created before plugin initialization (plugin_init()) for SST methods
    like rsync and xtrabackup.

    The threads' initialization itself can proceed in parallel to mysqld's
    main thread of execution. As a result, the thread initialization code
    (start_wsrep_THD()) can end up accessing some un/partially initialized
    structures (like maria_hton, in this particular case) resulting in
    segfault.

    Solution:
    Fixed by calling THD::init_for_queries() (which accesses maria_hton)
    only after the plugins have been initialized.

    MDEV-8754 Wrong result for SELECT..WHERE year_field=2020 AND NULLIF(year_field,2010)='2020'
    Problems:
    1. Item_func_nullif stored a copy of args[0] in a private member m_args0_copy,
       which was invisible for the inherited Item_func menthods, like
       update_used_tables(). As a result, after equal field propagation
       things like Item_func_nullif::const_item() could return wrong result
       and a non-constant NULLIF() was erroneously treated as a constant
       at optimize_cond() time.
       Solution: removing m_args0_copy and storing the return value item
       in args[2] instead.
    2. Equal field propagation did not work well for Item_fun_nullif.
       Solution: using ANY_SUBST for args[0] and args[1], as they are in
       comparison, and IDENTITY_SUBST for args[2], as it's not in comparison.

    Bug#1421360: Add 'FLUSH TABLES' to Total Order Isolation execution.

    Before this, FLUSH TABLES and FLUSH TABLES t1 (REFRESH_TABLES hereafter) were executed locally,
    which also had implications for GTID. MySQL async replication does
    replicate FLUSH TABLES.

    Hence, this commit

    a)  Adds REFRESH_TABLES to TOI.

    b) Skips LOCK-based REFRESH_TABLES from TOI, ie. FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
    LOCK and FLUSH TABLES FOR EXPORT.

    c) Executes them after reload_acl_and_cache. This is done since
    reload_acl_and_cache checks for thd->locked_tables_mode and does upgrade
    of MDL locks accordingly. A failure here means REFRESH_TABLES cannot
    run.

        i) This is also important since LOCK TABLES is not replicated in
        galera.

    d) Test galera_flush has been modified for

        i) wsrep_replicate_myisam SESSION variable.

        ii) Testing REFRESH_TABLES.

        iii) Testing REFRESH_TABLES + LOCK TABLES.

    e) Use different WSREP_TO_ISOLATION_BEGIN for global FLUSH TABLES and FLUSH TABLES <table,>.

    Synced xtrabackup SST fixes from Percona tree (as of PXC 5.6.24-25.11 release). This fixes/adresses the following LP bugs:
      - LP1380697: wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2 doesn't stop when mysql is SIGKILLed. (full fix for this (as engineeered by Percona) requires Linux-specific patch that we don't carry, but keep xtrabackup scripts as close as possible)
      - LP1399134: Log the innobackupex/SST logs in SST to syslog if possible. (fixed)
      - LP1405668: Race condition between donor and joiner in PXB SST. (fixed)
      - LP1405985: Fail early if xtrabackup_checkkpoints is missing. (fixed)
      - LP1407599: wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2 script causes innobackupex to print a false positive stack trace into the log. (fixed)
      - LP1441762: IST Fails with SST script error. (fixed)
      - LP1451670: Fail when move-back fails in xtrabackup SST. (fixed)

      1. Passes wsrep_sst_auth_value to SST scripts via WSREP_SST_OPT_AUTH envronmental variable, so it never appears on the command line
      2. In mysqldump and xtrabackup* SST scripts which rely on MySQL authentication, instead of passing password on the command line, SST script sets MYSQL_PWD environment variable, so that password also never appears on the mysqldump/innobackupex command line.

    removing IMPOSSIBLE_RESULT from Item_result, as it's not
    needed any more. The fact that an Item is not in a comparison
    context is now always designated by IDENTITY_SUBST in Subst_constraint.
    Previously IMPOSSIBLE_RESULT and IDENTITY_SUBST co-existed but
    actually meant the same thing.

       MDEV-8588: Assertion failure in file ha_innodb.cc line 21140 if at least one encrypted table exists and encryption service is not available

        Analysis: Problem was that in fil_read_first_page we do find that
        table has encryption information and that encryption service
        or used key_id is not available. But, then we just printed
        fatal error message that causes above assertion.

        Fix: When we open single table tablespace if it has encryption
        information (crypt_data) store this crypt data to the table
        structure. When we open a table and we find out that tablespace
        is not available, check has table a encryption information
        and from there is encryption service or used key_id is not available.
        If it is, add additional warning for SQL-layer.

    MDEV-8588: Assertion failure in file ha_innodb.cc line 21140 if at least one encrypted table exists and encryption service is not available

    Analysis: Problem was that in fil_read_first_page we do find that
    table has encryption information and that encryption service
    or used key_id is not available. But, then we just printed
    fatal error message that causes above assertion.

    Fix: When we open single table tablespace if it has encryption
    information (crypt_data) store this crypt data to the table
    structure. When we open a table and we find out that tablespace
    is not available, check has table a encryption information
    and from there is encryption service or used key_id is not available.
    If it is, add additional warning for SQL-layer.

    cleanup: Log_event::write() and MYSQL_BIN_LOG::write_cache()

    Introduce Log_event_writer() that encapsulates
    writing data to an IO_CACHE with automatic checksum calculation.

    Now all events properly checksum themselves as needed.

    Use Log_event_writer in MYSQL_BIN_LOG::write_cache() instead
    of copy-pasting its logic all over.

    Later Log_event_writer will also do encryption.

    cleanup: Log_event::read_log_event()

    There are three Log_event::read_log_event() methods:
    1. read the event image from IO_CACHE into String
    2. create Log_event from the in-memory event image
    3. read the event image from IO_CACHE and create Log_event

    The 3rd was reading event image into memory and invoking the 2nd to
    create Log_event. Now the 3rd also uses the 1st to read the event image
    from IO_CACHE into memory, instead of duplicating its functionality.

    New encryption API. Piece-wise encryption.

    Instead of encrypt(src, dst, key, iv) that encrypts all
    data in one go, now we have encrypt_init(key,iv),
    encrypt_update(src,dst), and encrypt_finish(dst).

    This also causes collateral changes in the internal my_crypt.cc
    encryption functions and in the encryption service.

    There are wrappers to provide the old all-at-once encryption
    functionality. But binlog events are often written piecewise,
    they'll need the new api.

    Fixed errors and bugs found by valgrind:

    - If run with valgrind, mysqltest will now wait longer when syncronizing slave with master
    - Ensure that we wait with cleanup() until slave thread has stopped.
    - Added signal_thd_deleted() to signal close_connections() that all THD's has been freed.
    - Check in handle_fatal_signal() that we don't use variables that has been freed.
    - Increased some timeouts when run with --valgrind

    Other things:
    - Fixed wrong test in one_thread_per_connection_end() if galera is used.
    - Removed not needed calls to THD_CHECK_SENTRY() when we are calling 'delete thd'.

    Item::cmp_context was inconsistently used in combination with cmp_type()

    in all places where cmp_context is involved, to avoid unexpected results
    for temporal data types (which have result_type()==STRING_RESULT and
    cmp_type==TIME_RESULT).

    Make galera-3 a Recommends instead of Depends in Debian packaging

    Having galera-3 as a Depends stops installation of proceeding
    on systems where package galera-3 is not available. The server
    can run fine withouth galera enabled, therefore a more slack
    relationship is more appropriate.

    MDEV-5146 : Bulk loads into partitioned table not working

    When wsrep is enabled, for any update on innodb tables, the
    corresponding keys are appended to galera's transaction writeset
    (wsrep_append_keys()). However, for LOAD DATA, this got skipped
    if binary logging was disabled or it was non-ROW based.
    As a result, while the updates from LOAD DATA on non-partitioned
    tables replicated fine as wsrep implicitly enables binary logging
    (if not enabled, explicitly), the same did not work on partitioned
    tables as for partitioned tables the binary logging gets disabled
    temporarily (ha_partition::write_row()).

    Fixed by removing the unwanted conditions from the check.
    Also backported some changes from 10.0-galera to make sure
    wsrep_load_data_splitting affects LOAD DATA commands only.

    Ensure that fields declared with NOT NULL doesn't have DEFAULT values if not specified and if not timestamp or auto_increment

    In original code, sometimes one got an automatic DEFAULT value in some cases, in other cases not.

    For example:
    create table t1 (a int primary key)      - No default
    create table t2 (a int, primary key(a))  - DEFAULT 0
    create table t1 SELECT ....              - Default for all fields, even if they where defined as NOT NULL
    ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY could sometimes add an unexpected DEFAULT value.

    The patch is quite big because we had some many test cases that used
    CREATE ... SELECT or CREATE ... (...PRIMARY KEY(xxx)) which doesn't have an automatic DEFAULT anymore.

    Other things:
    - Removed warnings from InnoDB when waiting from semaphore (got this when testing things with --big)

    MDEV-8475 stale .TMM file causes MyiSAM and Aria engine to stop serving the table

    Issue was two fold (both in MyISAM and Aria)
    - optimize and repair failed if there was an old .TMM file around. As optimized and repair are protected against multiple execution, I decided to change so that we just truncate the file if it exists.
    - I had missed to check for error condition if creation of the temporary index file failed. This caused the strange behaviour that it looked as if optimized would have worked once.

    MDEV-8589: Non-default ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID is ignored upon reading a table

    Analysis: Problem was that when a new tablespace is created a default
    encryption info is also created and stored to the tablespace. Later a
    new encryption information was created with correct key_id but that
    does not affect on IV.

    Fix: Push encryption mode and key_id to lower levels and create
    correct encryption info when a new tablespace is created.

    This fix does not contain test case because, currently incorrect
    encryption key causes page corruption and a lot of error messages
    to error log causing mtr to fail.

    MDEV-8617: Multiple galera tests failures with --ps-protocol

    In galera cluster, when myisam replication is enabled
    (wsrep_replicate_myisam=ON), DML statements are replicated
    in open_tables(). However, in case of prepared statements,
    for an INSERT, open_tables() gets invoked twice. Once for
    COM_STMT_PREPARE (to validate and prepare INSERT) and later
    for COM_STMT_EXECUTE. As a result, the command gets replicated
    twice. Same happens for REPLACE, UPDATE and DELETE commands.
    Fixed by adding a check to not replicate during 'prepare'
    phase. Also changed the order of conditions to make it more
    efficient. Lastly, in order to support wsrep_dirty_reads, made
    changes to allow COM_STMT_XXX commands to continue past initial
    check even when wsrep is not ready.

    MDEV-8598 : Failed MySQL DDL commands and Galera replication

    RENAME TABLE, unlike other DDLs, was getting replicated before
    the access check was performed. As a result, the command could
    get get replicated and thus executed on other nodes, even if it
    fails on the originating node due to permission issues. Fixed by
    moving the logic to check user privileges before replicating the
    command.

    MDEV-7205 : Galera cluster & sql_log_bin = off don't work

    While sql_bin_log=1(0) is meant to control binary logging for the
    current session so that the updates to do(not) get logged into the
    binary log to be replicated to the async MariaDB slave. The same
    should not affect galera replication.

    That is, the updates should always get replicated to other galera
    nodes regardless of sql_bin_log's value.

    Fixed by making sure that the updates are written to binlog cache
    irrespective of sql_bin_log.

    Added test cases.

    Fix: Add additional check that table really has primary key or
    unique key for InnoDB terms.

    MDEV-8410: Changing file-key-management to example-key-management causes crash and no real error
    MDEV-8409: Changing file-key-management-encryption-algorithm causes crash and no real info why

    Analysis: Both bugs has two different error cases. Firstly, at startup
    when server reads latest checkpoint but requested key_version,
    key management plugin or encryption algorithm or method is not found
    leading corrupted log entry. Secondly, similarly when reading system
    tablespace if requested key_version, key management plugin or encryption
    algorithm or method is not found leading buffer pool page corruption.

    Fix: Firsly, when reading checkpoint at startup check if the log record
    may be encrypted and if we find that it could be encrypted, print error
    message and do not start server. Secondly, if page is buffer pool seems
    corrupted but we find out that there is crypt_info, print additional
    error message before asserting.

    result, when plugins from packages, built along with MariaDB
    server like Connect & OQGraph are loaded and accessed by MGC,
    the objects may get initialized improperly.

    Fixed by moving the wsrep-additions to the end of the structure.

    create_or_replace as it could fail testcase timeout
    if you have slow I/O (tested that testcase passes with --mem).

    In galera, like other DDLs, CREATE/ALTER VIEW commands are recreated
    and replicated during parsing. The ALGORITHM clause is internally set
    to VIEW_ALGORITHM_INHERIT if its not explicitly specified by the user.
    But since its not a valid type to be used in a command, it leads to an
    assertion failure. The solution is to not include the ALGORITHM clause
    in the command if its not explicitly specified (or INHERIT).

    The optimizer thought that r = p was same as rand() = rand() and this would always be true.

    The problem was that when testing if two expressions are equal, we didn't take into account no determinstic functions.

    The fix is to not compare non deterministic functions as equal.

    MDEV-8469 Add RESET MASTER TO x to allow specification of binlog file nr

    Other things:
    - Avoid calling init_and_set_log_file_name() when opening binary log.
    - Remove newlines early when reading from index file.
    - Ensure that reset_logs() will work even if thd is 0 (Can happen on startup)
    - Added thd to sart_slave_threads() for better error handling.

    - Renaming variables so that they don't shadow others (After this patch one can compile with -Wshadow and get much fewer warnings)
    - Changed ER(ER_...) to ER_THD(thd, ER_...) when thd was known or if there was many calls to current_thd in the same function.
    - Changed ER(ER_..) to ER_THD_OR_DEFAULT(current_thd, ER...) in some places where current_thd is not necessary defined.
    - Removing calls to current_thd when we have access to thd

    Part of this is optimization (not calling current_thd when not needed),
    but part is bug fixing for error condition when current_thd is not defined
    (For example on startup and end of mysqld)

    Notable renames done as otherwise a lot of functions would have to be changed:
    - In JOIN structure renamed:
       examined_rows -> join_examined_rows
       record_count -> join_record_count
    - In Field, renamed new_field() to make_new_field()

    Other things:
    - Added DBUG_ASSERT(thd == tmp_thd) in Item_singlerow_subselect() just to be safe.
    - Removed old 'tab' prefix in JOIN_TAB::save_explain_data() and use members directly
    - Added 'thd' as argument to a few functions to avoid calling current_thd.

Author: Monty <monty@mariadb.org>
Date:   Sun Jul 5 12:39:46 2015 +0300

    Fixes done while working on MDEV-4119:

    Fixed several optimizer issues relatied to GROUP BY:

    a) Refering to a SELECT column in HAVING sometimes calculated it twice, which caused problems with non determinstic functions

    b) Removing duplicate fields and constants from GROUP BY was done too late for ""using index for group by"" optimization to work

    c) EXPLAIN SELECT ... GROUP BY did wrongly show 'Using filesort' in some cases involving ""Using index for group-by""

    a) was fixed by:
    - Changed last argument to Item::split_sum_func2() from bool to int to allow more flags
    - Added flag argument to Item::split_sum_func() to allow on to specify if the item was in the SELECT part
    - Mark all split_sum_func() calls from SELECT with SPLIT_SUM_SELECT
    - Changed split_sum_func2() to do nothing if called with an argument that is not a sum function and doesn't include sum functions, if we are not an argument to SELECT.

    This ensures that in a case like
    select a*sum(b) as f1 from t1 where a=1 group by c having f1 <= 10;

    That 'a' in the SELECT part is stored as a reference in the temporary table togeher with sum(b) while the 'a' in having isn't (not needed as 'a' is already a reference to a column in the result)

    b) was fixed by:
    - Added an extra remove_const() pass for GROUP BY arguments before make_join_statistics() in case of one table SELECT.

    This allowes get_best_group_min_max() to optimize things better.

    c) was fixed by:
    - Added test for group by optimization in JOIN::exec_inner for
      select->quick->get_type() == QUICK_SELECT_I::QS_TYPE_GROUP_MIN_MAX

    item.cc:
    - Simplifed Item::split_sum_func2()
      - Split test to make them faster and easier to read
      - Changed last argument to Item::split_sum_func2() from bool to int to allow more flags
      - Added flag argument to Item::split_sum_func() to allow on to specify if the item was in the SELECT part
      - Changed split_sum_func2() to do nothing if called with an argument that is not a sum function and doesn't include sum functions, if we are not an argument to SELECT.

    opt_range.cc:
    - Simplified get_best_group_min_max() by calcuating first how many group_by elements.
    - Use join->group instead of join->group_list to test if group by, as join->group_list may be NULL if everything was optimized away.

    sql_select.cc:
    - Added an extra remove_const() pass for GROUP BY arguments before make_join_statistics() in case of one table SELECT.
    - Use group instead of group_list to test if group by, as group_list may be NULL if everything was optimized away.
    - Moved printing of ""Error in remove_const"" to remove_const() instead of having it in caller.
    - Simplified some if tests by re-ordering code.
    - update_depend_map_for_order() and remove_const() fixed to handle the case where make_join_statistics() has not yet been called (join->join_tab is 0 in this case)

    When writing rows with a minimal row image, it is possible to receive

    values associated for that table.

    The rpl_injector code is now considered dead code.

    This patch only removes the minimum number of function calls
    to allow implementing binlog_row_image. The other functions are to be
    removed in a subsequent patch.

    MDEV-8390: innodb.innodb-flush-changed-page-bitmaps crashes

    Analysis: Flush changed page bitmaps calls log_online_follow_redo_log
    that later calls log_group_read_log_seg with release_mutex = true
    and that causes the log_sys mutex being released before
    log_decrypt_after_read function that later required log_sys mutex.

    Fix: Enter log_sys mutex before log_decrypt_after_read if mutex
    is released and release the mutex after the function if we
    acquired it before function call.

    ORDER BY against union may confuse name resolution context, causing valid

    The purpose of context change was presumably intended for the duration of
    gathering field list for ORDER BY. However it isn't actually required (name
    resolution context is never accessed by the latter).

    - MBR functions supported OP(const,field) optimization in 10.0,
    but were inintentionally broken in an earlier 10.1 change that introduced
    a common parent for Item_func_spatial_mbr_rel and Item_func_spatial_precise_rel.
    - Precise functions never supported optimization for OP(const,field).
    Now both MBR and precise functions support OP(const,field) optimization.

    MDEV-8199 - first_breadth_first_tab() takes 0.07% in OLTP RO

    This is an addition to original patch: cleanups for next_breadth_first_tab().

    Overhead change:
    next_breadth_first_tab()  0.04% -> out of radar

    MDEV-8199 - first_breadth_first_tab() takes 0.07% in OLTP RO

    Split first_breadth_first_tab() into
    JOIN::first_breadth_first_optimization_tab() and
    JOIN::first_breadth_first_execution_tab().

    This allows to eliminate function call and one condition. Adjusted callers
    accordingly.

    Overhead change:
    first_breadth_first_tab()        0.07% -> out of radar
    next_breadth_first_tab()         0.04% -> 0.04%
    JOIN::cleanup()                  0.15% -> 0.11%
    JOIN::save_explain_data_intern() 0.28% -> 0.24%

    MDEV-8030 - Apc_target::disable() locks mutex twice

    Moved Apc_target::destroy(), Apc_target::enable() and Apc_targe::disable()
    definitions to my_apc.h so that they can be inlined.

    Apc_targe::disable() now calls Apc_target::process_apc_requests() only if
    there're APC requests. This saves one pthread_mutex_lock() call.

    Overhead change:
    Apc_target::disable              0.04% -> out of radar
    Apc_target::enable               0.03% -> out of radar
    Apc_target::process_apc_requests 0.02% -> out of radar
    pthread_mutex_lock               0.43% -> 0.42%
    pthread_mutex_unlock             0.26% -> 0.25%

    MDEV-7952 - clock_gettime() takes 0.24% in OLTP RO

    Initialize abs_timeout when it is about to be used. This saves one my_hrtime()
    call on hot path (when we acquire MDL lock without waiting).

    When filling I_S.PROCESSLIST use THD::start_utime/THD::utime_after_query instead
    of THD::start_time. This allows us to save 2 clock_gettime() calls.

    Overhead change:
    __clock_gettime   0.13% -> 0.11% (122 -> 76 calls per OLTP RO transaction)
    my_interval_timer 0.07% -> 0.06%

    MDEV-8303; Dumping buffer pool noisy in the logs.

    Added new dynamic configuration variable innodb_buf_dump_status_frequency
    to configure how often buffer pool dump status is printed in the logs.
    A number between [0, 100] that tells how oftern buffer pool dump status
    in percentages should be printed. E.g. 10 means that buffer pool dump
    status is printed when every 10% of number of buffer pool pages are
    dumped. Default is 0 (only start and end status is printed).

    MDEV-8250: InnoDB: Page compressed tables are not compressed and compressed+encrypted tables cause crash

    Analysis: Problem is that both encrypted tables and compressed tables use
    FIL header offset FIL_PAGE_FILE_FLUSH_LSN_OR_KEY_VERSION to store
    required metadata. Furhermore, for only compressed tables currently
    code skips compression.

    Fixes:
    - Only encrypted pages store key_version to FIL header offset FIL_PAGE_FILE_FLUSH_LSN_OR_KEY_VERSION,
      no need to fix
    - Only compressed pages store compression algorithm to FIL header offset FIL_PAGE_FILE_FLUSH_LSN_OR_KEY_VERSION,
      no need to fix as they have different page type FIL_PAGE_PAGE_COMPRESSED
    - Compressed and encrypted pages now use a new page type FIL_PAGE_PAGE_COMPRESSED_ENCRYPTED and
      key_version is stored on FIL header offset FIL_PAGE_FILE_FLUSH_LSN_OR_KEY_VERSION and compression
      method is stored after FIL header similar way as compressed size, so that first
      FIL_PAGE_COMPRESSED_SIZE is stored followed by FIL_PAGE_COMPRESSION_METHOD
    - Fix buf_page_encrypt_before_write function to really compress pages if compression is enabled
    - Fix buf_page_decrypt_after_read function to really decompress pages if compression is used
    - Small style fixes

    my_b_fill, inline my_b_* functions instead of hairy macros

    misc IO_CACHE cleanups

    * remove unused (and not implemented) WRITE_NET type
    * remove cast in my_b_write() macro. my_b_* macros are
      function-like, casts are responsibility of the caller
    * replace hackish _my_b_write(info,0,0) with the explicit
      my_b_flush_io_cache() in my_b_write_byte()
    * remove unused my_b_fill_cache()
    * replace pbool -> my_bool
    * make internal IO_CACHE functions static
    * reformat comments, correct typos, remove obsolete comments (ISAM)
    * assert valid cache type in init_functions()
    * use IO_ROUND_DN() macro where appropriate
    * remove unused DBUG_EXECUTE_IF in _my_b_cache_write()
    * remove unnecessary __attribute__((unused))
    * fix goto error in parse_file.cc
    * remove redundant reinit_io_cache() in uniques.cc
    * don't do reinit_io_cache() if the cache was not initialized
      in ma_check.c
    * extract duplicate functionality from various _my_b_*_read
      functions into a common wrapper. Same for _my_b_*_write
    * create _my_b_cache_write_r instead of having if's in
      _my_b_cache_write (similar to existing _my_b_cache_read and
      _my_b_cache_read_r)
    * don't call mysql_file_write() from my_b_flush_io_cache(),
      call info->write_function() instead

    cleanup: LOAD DATA replication support in IO_CACHE

    remove some 14-year old code that added support for
    LOAD DATA replication to IO_CACHE:
    * three callbacks, of which only two were actually used and that
      were only needed for LOAD DATA replication but were
      tested in every IO_CACHE instance
    * an additional opaque void * argument in IO_CACHE, also only
      used for LOAD DATA replication, but present everywhere
    * the code to close IO_CACHE prematurely in LOAD DATA to have
      these callbacks called in the correct order and a long
      comment explaining what will happen if IO_CACHE is not
      closed prematurely
    * a variable to track whether IO_CACHE was closed prematurely
      (to avoid double-closing it)

    A helper patch for ""MDEV-8228 Move Item_func_like out of Item_bool_func2""

    - Changing Comp_creator::create() and create_swap() to return
      Item_bool_rowready_func2 instead of Item_bool_func2, as they
      can never return neither Item_func_like nor Item_func_xor

    - Changing the first argument of Comp_create::create() and create_swap()
      from THD to MEM_ROOT, so the method implementations can now reside in
      item_cmpfunc.h instead of item_cmpfunc.cc and thus make the code slightly
      easier to read.

    MDEV-8195: InnoDB: Error: trying to access tablespace 11262 page no. 7, InnoDB: but the tablespace does not exist or is just being dropped.

    Analysis: Problem was that we did try to read from tablespace
    that was being dropped.

    Fixed by introducing a new function to find a tablespace only
    if it is not being dropped currently and adding this check
    before trying to read pages from tablespace.

    MDEV-8182: Failing assertion: 1 == UT_LIST_GET_LEN(space->chain)

    Analysis: At fil_spage_get_space there is small change that space
    is found from tablespace list but we have not yet created node
    for it (and added it to space->chain) and as we hold fil_system
    mutex here fil_node_create can't continue.

    Fixed by allowing UT_LIST_GET_LEN(space->chain) == 0|| 1 and
    introducint two new functions that access filespace list
    and before returning space check that node is also created.

    MDEV-8173: InnoDB; Failing assertion: crypt_data->type == 1

    Make sure that when we publish the crypt_data we access the
    memory cache of the tablespace crypt_data. Make sure that
    crypt_data is stored whenever it is really needed.

    All this is not yet enough in my opinion because:

    sql/encryption.cc has DBUG_ASSERT(scheme->type == 1) i.e.
    crypt_data->type == CRYPT_SCHEME_1

    However, for InnoDB point of view we have global crypt_data
    for every tablespace. When we change variables on crypt_data
    we take mutex. However, when we use crypt_data for
    encryption/decryption we use pointer to this global
    structure and no mutex to protect against changes on
    crypt_data.

    Tablespace encryption starts in fil_crypt_start_encrypting_space
    from crypt_data that has crypt_data->type = CRYPT_SCHEME_UNENCRYPTED
    and later we write page 0 CRYPT_SCHEME_1 and finally whe publish
    that to memory cache.

    MDEV-7951 - sql_alloc() takes 0.25% in OLTP RO

    sql_alloc() has additional costs compared to direct mem_root allocation:
    - function call: it is defined in a separate translation unit and can't be
      inlined
    - it needs to call pthread_getspecific() to get THD::mem_root

    It is called dozens of times implicitely at least by:
    - List<>::push_back()
    - List<>::push_front()
    - new (for Sql_alloc derived classes)
    - sql_memdup()

    Replaced lots of implicit sql_alloc() calls with direct mem_root allocation,
    passing through THD pointer whenever it is needed.

    Number of sql_alloc() calls reduced 345 -> 41 per OLTP RO transaction.
    pthread_getspecific() overhead dropped 0.76 -> 0.59
    sql_alloc() overhed dropped 0.25 -> 0.06

    MDEV-7964 - delete_dynamic() takes 0.12% in OLTP RO

    delete_dynamic() was called 9-11x per OLTP RO query + 3x per BEGIN/COMMIT.

    3 calls were performed by LEX_MASTER_INFO. Added condition to call those only
    for CHANGE MASTER.

    1 call was performed by lock_table_names()/Hash_set/my_hash_free(). Hash_set was
    supposed to be used for DDL and LOCK TABLES to gather database names, while it
    was initialized/freed for DML too. In fact Hash_set didn't do any useful job
    here. Hash_set was removed and MDL requests are now added directly to the list.

    The rest 5-7 calls are done by optimizer, mostly by Explain_query and friends.
    Since dynamic arrays are used in most cases, they can hardly be optimized.

    my_hash_free() overhead dropped 0.02 -> out of radar.
    delete_dynamic() overhead dropped 0.12 -> 0.04.

    MDEV-7926 Server crashes in get_geometry_column_record on concurrent SELECT FROM I_S.GEOMETRY_COLUMNS with join and DDL.
             The bug was that open_tables() returned error in case of
            thd->killed() without properly calling thd->send_kill_message()
            to set the correct error. This was fixed already in get_schema_column_record,
            so the code was just copied to get_geometry_column_record.

    MDEV-7942: InnoDB: abuse of UNIV_LIKELY()/UNIV_UNLIKELY()

    UNIV_LIKELY()/UNIV_UNLIKELY() hints are supposed to improve branch prediction.
    Currently, they're expected to work only if cond evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.

    However there're a few conditions that may evaluate to different values, e.g.:

    page/page0zip.cc:		if (UNIV_LIKELY(c_stream->avail_in)) {
    page/page0zip.cc:			if (UNIV_LIKELY(c_stream->avail_in)) {
    dict/dict0mem.cc:		if (UNIV_LIKELY(i) && UNIV_UNLIKELY(!table->col_names)) {

    Fixed these conditions so that they evaluate TRUE/FALSE.

    MDEV-8113: Parallel slave: slave hangs on ALTER TABLE (or other DDL) as the first event after slave start

    In optimistic parallel replication, it is not safe to try to run a following
    transaction in parallel with a DDL statement, and there is code to prevent
    this.

    However, the code was missing the case where the DDL is the very first event
    after slave start. In this case, following transactions could run in
    parallel with the DDL, which can cause the slave to hang or even corrupt
    slave in unlucky cases.

    MDEV-7922 - ERROR 1939 (HY000): Engine PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA failed to discover
                table

    Performance schema discovery fails if connection has no active database set.

    This happened due to restriction in SQL parser: table name with no database name
    is ambiguous in such case.

    Fixed by temporary substitution of default database with being discovered table
    database.

    - Fix MDEV-7935 by suppressing error resetting code in delete_or_rename_table.
      However, the issue is that this code was added because without it an assertion
      was raised in some cases. Unfortunately I can't remember what were these cases.
      Therefore fixing it in this case will perhaps make a new crash happening on another cases.

    MDEV-7950 Item_func::type() takes 0.26% in OLTP RO
    Step 2c:

    After discussion with Igor, it appeared that Item_field and Item_ref
    could not appear in this context in the old function build_equal_item_for_cond:

      else if (cond->type() == Item::FUNC_ITEM ||
               cond->real_item()->type() == Item::FIELD_ITEM)

    The part of the condition checking for Item_field::FIELD_ITEM was a dead code.
    - Moving implementation of Item_ident_or_func_or_sum::build_equal_items()
    to Item_func::build_equal_items()
    - Restoring deriving of Item_ident and Item_sum_or_func from Item_result_field.
      Removing Item_ident_or_func_or_sum.

    MDEV-8073 - Build error in sql/mdl.cc on OS X 10.10

    C++03 seem to require default constructor for const objects even though they're
    fully initialized. There is defect report for this:
    http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#253

    Apparently some compilers (e.g. gcc) addressed this defect report, while some
    (e.g. clang) did not.

    Added empty default constructor to MDL_scoped_lock and MDL_object_lock classes.

    Also replaced lf_hash_search_using_hash_value() with lf_hash_search(). The
    latter will call mdl_key->hash_value() anyway.

    MDEV-7950 Item_func::type() takes 0.26% in OLTP RO (Step#2)

    - Item_ref was doing unnecessary extra job after the ""MDEV-7950 Step#2"" patch.
      Fallback to Item::build_equal_items() if real_type() is not FIELD_ITEM.
      Note, Item_ref::build_equal_items() will most likely be further simplified.
      Waiting for Sanja and Igor to check a possibly dead code.

    - Safety: Adding Item_sum::build_equal_items() with ASSERT, as Item_sum
      should never appear in build_equal_items() context.

    MDEV-7950 Item_func::type() takes 0.26% in OLTP RO

    Step#2:

    1. Removes the function build_equal_items_for_cond() and
       introduces a new method Item::build_equal_items() instead,
       with specific implementations in the following Items:

       Item  (the default implementation)
       Item_ident_or_func_or_sum
       Item_cond
       Item_cond_and

    2. Adds a new abstract class Item_ident_or_func_or_sum,
       a common parent for Item_ident and Item_func_or_sum,
       as they have exactly the same build_equal_items().

    3. Renames Item_cond_and::cond_equal to Item_cond_and::m_cond_equal,
       to avoid confusion between the member and local variables named
       ""cond_equal"".

    MDEV-7995 : DMLs not getting replicated with log-bin=OFF & binlog-format != ROW

    This bug is a side-effect of fix for MDEV-6924, where we completely
    stopped a statement-based event from getting into the binlog cache when
    binary logging is not enabled (and thus, wsrep_emulate_binlog mode = 1).
    As a result, the SBR events were not replicated.

    Fixed by allowing the SBR events to be written into the binlog cache.

    Note: Only DMLs were affected as DDLs are replicated via TOI.

    Merged galera_create_trigger.test from github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Author: Alexander Barkov <bar@mariadb.org>
Date:   Fri Apr 17 12:36:31 2015 +0400

    Moving fix_length_and_dec() from Item_result_field to Item_func_or_sum,
    as the other decendants of Item_result_field (Item_avg_field,
    Item_variance_field, Item_cache_wrapper) don't need fix_length_and_dec().

Author: Alexander Barkov <bar@mariadb.org>
Date:   Fri Apr 17 09:52:44 2015 +0400

    Minor reorganization in Item hierarchy, to remove duplicate code.

    - Adding a new class Item_args, represending regular function or
      aggregate function arguments array.

    - Adding a new class Item_func_or_sum,
      a parent class for Item_func and Item_sum

    - Moving Item_result_field::name() to Item_func_or_sum(),
      as name() is not needed on Item_result_field level.

    MDEV-7996 : CURRENT_USER definer does not replicate for triggers

    THD's lex->definer initially holds ""*current_user"" for CURRENT_USER().
    As a result when wsrep tries to create the trigger query, it incorrectly
    uses ""*current_user"". Fixed by calling get_current_user() to get the
    real current user.

    Merged galera_create_trigger.test from github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

    * compression+encryption did not work in either branch before the

      broken after the merge though - some of that code was not merged.
    * page checksumming code was not moved (moving of page checksumming

    MDEV-7860: EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON crashes for loose scan query

    (Based on original patch by Sanja Byelkin)
    Make the code that produces JSON output handle LooseScan quick select.

    The output we produce is compatible with MySQL 5.6.

    MDEV-7888, MDEV-7929: Parallel replication hangs sometimes on ANALYZE TABLE or DDL

    Follow-up patch with 10.1-specific changes.

    Add test cases that more closely resembles the original bug report (which uses
    the 10.1-specific --slave-parallel-mode=optimistic).

    Also fix the code so that ANALYZE statements are now marked as DDL, and will
    not be attempted to speculatively run in parallel with other transactions.

    tests for file_key_management plugin key file parser

commit e02749aaf5559384ef130e53aaaf02a33e5bcac3
Author: Sergei Golubchik <serg@mariadb.org>
Date:   Sat Mar 28 13:25:25 2015 +0100

    completely rewrote file_key_management plugin

    numerous issues fixed:
    * buffer overflows
    * error conditions aren't checked (crash if file doesn't exist)
    * accessing random unallocated memory
    * hard-coded password
    * arbitrary hard-coded key id limit
    * incomprehensible error messages (for key_id == 0 it reported
      ""The key could not be initialized"", for syntax errors the message was
      ""Wrong match of the keyID, see the template"", for a key id
      larger than hard-coded limit the message was ""No asked key"", and there
      was an error ""Is comment"" for a comment).
    * tons of small mallocs, many are freed few lines down in the code
    * malloc(N) and new char[N] are used both, even in the same function
    * redundant memory copies
    * pcre - ""I can solve it with regular expressions"" - with incorrect regexes
    * parser context stored in a singleton
    * keys are stored as strings and are strlen-ed and hex2bin-ed on every
      get_key() request
    * lots of useless code (e.g. sprintf instead of a pointer assignment,
      checking of the file length to read a part of it in a fixed buffer,
      multiplying by sizeof(char) in many places, etc)
    * this list is not exhaustive

    in particular, ""innodb.innodb-page_encryption,xtradb"" should
    select these three tests:

    innodb.innodb-page_encryption 'cbc,xtradb' [ pass ]  35563
    innodb.innodb-page_encryption 'ctr,xtradb' [ pass ]  36858
    innodb.innodb-page_encryption 'ecb,xtradb' [ pass ]  36741

    and deselect all innodb_plugin tests. This was not the case, because
    the %test_combs hash was destructively modified in the loop

    small cleanup

    * my_aes.h doesn't compile without my_global.h
    * typo in a comment
    * redundant condition
    * if encryption plugin fails, there's no encryption_key_manager
      at plugin deinit time
    * encryption plugin tests must run when plugin.so is present,
      not when a plugin is active (otherwise the test will be skipped
      when plugin fails to initialize).

    MDEV-7878: innodb_scrub_background fails sporadically in buildbot (Failing assertion: offset > 0 && offset < UNIV_PAGE_SIZE)

    Problem was that when encrypted space was flushed page 0 is
    also updated but crypt data offset was sometimes not
    calculated.

    MDEV-7825: Parallel replication race condition on gco->flags, possibly resulting in slave hang

    The patch for optimistic parallel replication as a memory optimisation moved
    the gco->installed field into a bit in gco->flags. However, that is just plain
    wrong. The gco->flags field is owned by the SQL driver thread, but
    gco->installed is used by the worker threads, so this will cause a race
    condition.

    The user-visible problem might be conflicts between transactions and/or slave
    threads hanging.

    So revert this part of the optimistic parallel replication patch, going back
    to using a separate field gco->installed like in 10.0.

    MDEV-7802 Add status binlog_group_commit_reason_*

    The following global status variables where added:
    * binlog_group_commit_reason_count
    * binlog_group_commit_reason_usec
    * binlog_group_commit_reason_transaction
    * binlog_group_commit_reason_immediate

    binlog_group_commit_reason_count corresponds to group commits made by
    virtue of the binlog_commit_wait_count variable.

    binlog_group_commit_reason_usec corresponds to the binlog_commit_wait_usec
    variable.

    binlog_group_commit_reason_transaction is a result of ordered
    transaction that need to occur in the same order on the slave and can't
    be parallelised.

    binlog_group_commit_reason_immediate is caused to prevent stalls with
    row locks as described in log.cc:binlog_report_wait_for. This immediate
    count is also counted a second time in binlog_group_commit_reason_transaction.

    Overall binlog_group_commits = binlog_group_commit_reason_count +
    binlog_group_commit_reason_usec + binlog_group_commit_reason_transaction

    This work was funded thanks to Open Source Developers Club Australia.

    MDEV-7728 - Improve xid cache scalability by using lock-free hash

    XID cache is now based on lock-free hash.
    Also fixed lf_hash_destroy() to call alloc destructor.

    Note that previous implementation had race condition when thread was accessing
    XA owned by different thread. This new implementation doesn't fix it either.

    MDEV-7529 GIS: ST_Relate returns unexpected results for POINT relations.
    Problem was that we considered the point itself as the 'border' object. Instead
    of that the 'border' of a POINT is an empty set, and the point is the 'interior'.
    Another error fixed by the way - not all operations of the resulting function were properly
    allocated.

    MASTER_GTID_WAIT function needs some status to evaluate its use.

    master_gtid_wait_count indicates how many times the function is called.
    master_gtid_wait_time indicates how much time in microseconds occurred
    waiting (or timing out)
    master_gtid_timeouts indicates how many time times this function timed
    out rather than all successful gtids events being available.

    MDEV-7203: replicate_events_marked_for_skip didn't work on Galera cluster

    OPTION_SKIP_REPLICATION flag needs to be preserved for events received
    on non-originating nodes.

    MDEV-7273 - 10.1 fails to start up during tc_log initializations on PPC64

    log-tc-size is 24K by default. Page size is 64K on PPC64. But log-tc-
    size
    must be at least 3 x page size. This is enforced by TC_LOG_MMAP::open()
    with a comment: to guarantee non-empty pool.

    This all makes server not startable in default configuration on PPC64.

    Autosize log-tc-size, so that it's min value= page size * 3, default
    value= page size * 6, block size= page size.

    MDEV-7061: Augment innochecksum to give insight of fragmentation

    Merged https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6/commit/615dd07d900ce08948340b6c11e37fd1d2a91065 from https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6/
    authored by rongrong. Removed C++11 requirement by using
    std::map instead of std::unordered_set.

    Add analysis to leaf pages to estimate how fragmented an index is
    and how much benefit we can get out of defragmentation.

    Simplified MDL_object_lock and MDL_scoped_lock dichotomy so that they can be

    MDL_lock_strategy structure which is referenced from the MDL_lock object by
    pointer.

    MDEV-6960 Server crashes in check_alter_user on setting a default role via PS

    There were two issues:

    * set_var_default_role::user was overwritten with a new value,
      allocated in the thd->mem_root, which is reset between executions.
      That was causing the crash. Solved by introducing set_var_default_role::real_user

    * when privilege tables were opened on EXECUTE, the reprepare_observer
      would abort the statement (as privilege tables are opened using

    MDEV-6676: Optimistic parallel replication

    Adjust the configuration options, as discussed on the
    maria-developers@ mailing list.

    The option to hint a transaction to not be replicated in parallel is
    now called @@skip_parallel_replication, consistent with
    @@skip_replication.

    And the --slave-parallel-mode is now simplified to have just one of
    the following values:

      none
      minimal
      conservative
      optimistic
      aggressive

    This reflects successively harder efforts to find opportunities to run
    things in parallel on the slave. It allows to extend the server with
    more automatic heuristics in the future without having to introduce a
    new configuration option for each and every one.

    MDEV-7201: parallel threads resizing - potential race condition to access freed memory

    pool->threads is freed before being reassigned the new pool.

    Although not really a memory barrier I though it prudent to keep the pool
    thread count to be the lower of the old/new thread list before the new threads
    is allocated.

    MDEV-7177 - Server hangs on shutdown after InnoDB error (main.plugin_loaderr
                fails in buildbot)

    There was a race condition in timer functionality of query timeouts.

    Race was as following:
    main thread:          init_thr_timers()
    timer handler thread: my_thread_init()
    main thread:          end_thr_timer()/timer_thread_state= ABORTING
    timer handler thread: timer_thread_state= RUNNING, continue normal op
    main thread:          waits indefinitely for timer handler thread to go down

    The original idea of the fix is to set RUNNING state in main thread, before
    starting timer handler thread. But it didn't survive further cleanups:
    - removed ""timer_thread_state"" and used ""thr_timer_inited"" for this purpose
    - removed unused ""timer_thread_running""
    - removed code responisble for ""timer handler thread"" shutdown synchronization,
      use pthread_join() instead.

    MDEV-7499 - System variables have broken default values on big endian

    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_VARIABLES.DEFAULT_VALUE had broken values on
    big endian.

    Default value is internally stored as longlong, while I_S references it's
    pointer (longlong *) according to variable type (e.g. int, my_bool, etc). This
    works well on little endian, but on big endian we always get 0 for such
    variables.

    MDEV-7123 : MariaDB 10.0.14 Galera node shutdown with signal 11

    wsrep-patch uses same connection name for constructing Master_info
    objects. As a result all existing wsrep Master_info objects refer
    to same rpl_filter object. This could lead to race when multiple
    threads try to delete/destruct Master_info object, as they would
    all try to delete the same relay_log object.

    Fixed by adding a check in Master_info's destructor to not free
    the ""wsrep"" rpl_filter, so that its reused by current & subsequent
    wsrep threads and later reclaimed by free_all_rpl_filters() during
    server shutdown.

    bugfix: incorrect cast causing random memory write

    options->app_type was set to mysql_sysvar_t* pointer,
    later changed to sys_var* pointer, and even later dereferenced as
    sys_var*. But for PLUGIN_VAR_NOSYSVAR variables the pointer wasn't
    changed to sys_var*, so mysql_sysvar_t* pointer was dereferenced
    (and updated!) as if it was sys_var*.

    This caused maria.maria-gis-recovery test failure on x86 (fulltest2).

    MDEV-7424: InnoDB: Assertion failure in thread 139901753345792
      in file buf0mtflu.cc line 439

      Analysis: At shutdown multi-threaded flush sends a exit work
      items to all mtflush threads. We wait until the work queue is
      empty. However, as we did not hold the mutex, some other thread
      could also put work-items to work queue.

      Fix: Take mutex before adding exit work items to work queue and
      wait until all work-items are really processed. Release
      mutex after we have marked that multi-threaded flush is not
      anymore active.

      Fix test failure on innodb_bug12902967 caused by unnecessary
      info output on xtradb/buf/buf0mtflush.cc.

       Do not try to enable atomic writes if the file type
       is not OS_DATA_FILE. Atomic writes are unnecessary
       for log files. If we try to enable atomic writes
       to log writes that are stored to media supporting
       atomic writes we will end up problems later.

    MDEV-7391: rpl.rpl_semi_sync, rpl.rpl_semi_sync_after_sync_row fail in buildbot

    The problem was caused by a merge error (incorrect conflict resolution) when
    the MDEV-7257 patch was merged into 10.1.

    The incorrect merge put two code blocks in the wrong order. This caused a race
    that was seen as sporadic test failures.

    (The problem was that binlog end position was updated before running
    after_flush hook; this way it was possible for the binlog dump thread to send
    a transaction to a slave without requesting semi-sync acknowledgement. Then
    when no acknowledgement was received, semisync replication would be disabled
    on the master.)

    MDEV-162 Enhanced semisync replication

    Implement --semi-sync-master-wait-point=AFTER_SYNC|AFTER_COMMIT.

    When AFTER_SYNC, the semi-sync wait will be done earlier, before the storage
    engine commit rather than after. This means that a transaction will not be
    visible on the master until at least one slave has received it.

    MDEV-7257: Dump Thread Enhancements

    Make the binlog dump threads not need to take LOCK_log while sending
    binlog events to slave. Instead, a new LOCK_binlog_end_pos is used
    just to coordinate tracking the current end-of-log.

    This is a pre-requisite for MDEV-162, ""Enhanced semisync
    replication"". It should also help reduce the contention on LOCK_log on
    a busy master.

    Also does some much-needed refactoring/cleanup of the related code in
    the binlog dump thread.

    MDEV-6676: Optimistic parallel replication

    Implement a new mode for parallel replication. In this mode, all transactions
    are optimistically attempted applied in parallel. In case of conflicts, the
    offending transaction is rolled back and retried later non-parallel.

    This is an early-release patch to facilitate testing, more changes to user
    interface / options will be expected. The new mode is not enabled by default.

    Fixed valgrind warnings in delete_dynamic().

    Join_plan_state performs out-of-API initialization of DYNAMIC_ARRAY. This is
    done to postpone actual array initialization till first use, whilst retaining
    the right to call delete_dynamic().

    Since delete_dynamic() now checks DYNAMIC_ARRAY::malloc_flags it should be
    initialized it as well.

    MDEV-7004 - Merge scalability fixes from 10.0-power

    All callers of open_cached_file() use 2 characters prefix. Allocating memory for
    such short string is an overkill. Store it on IO_CACHE structure instead.

    All callers of open_cached_file() use mysql_tmpdir as dir. No need to allocate
    memory for it since it is constant and available till server shutdown.

    This reduces number of allocations from 31 to 27 per OLTP RO transaction.

    GRANT: calculate pasword hash in sql_acl.cc

    don't do it in the parser, one should not make run-time
    decisions (like, checking thd->variables.old_passwords variable)
    during parsing.

    MDEV-7108: Make long semaphore wait timeout configurable

    Merge Facebook commit https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6/commit/cd063ab930f05efdba39d504543998512d1bd71f
    authored by Peng Tian from https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6

    Introduced a new configuration variable innodb_fatal_semaphore_wait_threshold,
    it makes the fatal semaphore timeout configurable. Modified original commit
    so that no MariaDB server files are changed, instead introduced a new
    InnoDB/XtraDB configuration variable.

    Its default/min/max vlaues are 600/1/2^32-1 in seconds (it was hardcoded
    as 600, now its default value is 600, so the default behavior of this diff
    should be no change).

    authored by Inaam Rana to InnoDB storage engine (not XtraDB)
    from https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6

    WL#7047 - Optimize buffer pool list scans and related batch processing

    Reduce excessive scanning of pages when doing flush list batches. The
    fix is to introduce the concept of ""Hazard Pointer"", this reduces the
    time complexity of the scan from O(n*n) to O.

    The concept of hazard pointer is reversed in this work. Academically
    hazard pointer is a pointer that the thread working on it will declar
    such and as long as that thread is not done no other thread is allowe
    do anything with it.

    In this WL we declare the pointer as a hazard pointer and then if any
    thread attempts to work on it, it is allowed to do so but it has to a
    the hazard pointer to the next valid value. We use hazard pointer sol
    reverse traversal of lists within a buffer pool instance.

    Add an event to control the background flush thread. The background f
    thread wait has been converted to an os event timed wait so that it c
    signalled by threads that want to kick start a background flush when
    buffer pool is running low on free/dirty pages.

    Optimize prefix index queries to skip cluster index lookup when possible.

    Currently InnoDB will always fetch the clustered index (primary key
    index) for all prefix columns in an index, even when the value of a
    particular record is smaller than the prefix length. This change
    optimizes that case to use the record from the secondary index and avoid
    the extra lookup.

    Also adds two status vars that track how effective this is:

    innodb_secondary_index_triggered_cluster_reads:
    Times secondary index lookup triggered cluster lookup.

    innodb_secondary_index_triggered_cluster_reads_avoided:
    Times prefix optimization avoided triggering cluster lookup.

    Adds innodb_idle_flush_pct to enable tuning of the page flushing rate
    when the system is relatively idle. We care about this, since doing
    extra unnecessary flash writes shortens the lifespan of the flash.

    MDEV-6935: Change the default value for innodb_log_compressed_pages to false

    Merge Facebook commit ca40b4417fd224a68de6636b58c92f133703fc68
    authored by Steaphan Greene from https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6
    Change the default value for innodb_log_compressed_pages to false

    Logging these pages is a waste. We don't want this to be enabled.

    One caution here: If the zlib version used by innodb is changed, but
    the running version is still the previous version, and the running
    version crashes, it is possible crash recovery could fail.

    When crash recovery uses a zlib version at all different than the
    version used by the crashed instance, it is possible that a redone
    compression could fail, where the original did not, because the new
    zlib version compresses the same data to a slightly larger size.

    Because of the nature of compression, this is even possible when
    upgrading to a version of zlib which actually peforms overall better
    compression than the previous version.

    If this happens, mysql will fail to recover, since a page split can
    not be safely triggered during crash recovery.

    So, either the exact zlib version must be controlled between builds,
    or these rare recovery failures must be accepted. The cost of
    logging these pages is quite high, so we consider this limitation to
    be worthwhile.

    This failure scenario can not happen if there was a clean shutdown.
    This is only relevant to restarting crashed instances, or starting an
    instance built via a hot backup too (XtraBackup).

    make sure that we do not use 0 as file_block_size (512 is the minimum).

    MDEV-6603 SBR failure upon executing a prepared statement with input placeholder under anonymous block

    Normally, Prepared_statement object rewrites the query on execution
    to replace ?-placeholders with values. The rewritten query may be written
    to logs (including binlog) or stored in the query cache.

    But for compound statements, the whole block is prepared and executed,
    while contained statements are logged individually. So it doesn't make
    sense to rewrite the original statement block. Instead, we need to rewrite
    every contained statement. SP is already doing it to replace SP variables
    with values. Let it rewrite PS parameters too in the same loop.

    cleanup: query rewrites for Item_param and Item_splocal

    Fix query rewrites in PS code - it was memcpy-ing the same query tail
    many times. Instead use the same logic as in SP code, copy query pieces
    into the destination buffer.

    Extract this logic into a separate class Rewritable_query_parameter
    with Item_param and Item_splocal inheriting from it.

    Create a helper class Copy_query_with_rewrite that incapsulates
    the query rewriting logic, use it in SP and PS.

    MDEV-6481: Yum Upgrade on CentOS 6.5 causes instant
    crash of MariaDB/Galera

    mysqld crashes during startup when its started with --wsrep-recover
    (mysqld_safe.sh). The problem was that during server startup ""wsrep""
    handle is not initialized for --wsrep-recover and since the condition
    to register wsrep hton depended only on 'wsrep_on' global/session
    variables (WSREP(thd) macro), it can eventually get registered and
    calls to wsrep handle's functions (commit, rollback, etc.) can be
    made (SIGSEGV!).

    Fixed by adding a check for ""wsrep"" pointer in WSREP(thd) macro
    (added by lp:1367173). Additionally, a check for WSREP(thd)
    (instead of checking the availability of wsrep provider) has been
    added before invoking wsrep handle's commit & rollback functions.

    MDEV 4427: query timeouts

    Added MAX_STATEMENT_TIME user variable to automaticly kill queries after a given time limit has expired.

    - Added timer functions based on pthread_cond_timedwait
    - Added kill_handlerton() to signal storage engines about kill/timeout
    - Added support for GRANT ... MAX_STATEMENT_TIME=#
    - Copy max_statement_time to current user, if stored in mysql.user
    - Added status variable max_statement_time_exceeded
    - Added KILL_TIMEOUT
    - Removed digest hash from performance schema tests as they change all the time.
    - Updated test results that changed because of the new user variables or new fields in mysql.user

    This functionallity is inspired by work done by Davi Arnaut at twitter.
    Test case is copied from Davi's work.

    The problem was that the internal temporary table created
    for information_schema overflow to MyISAM because it has

    Fix was to increase size for the heap table.

    and innodb.innodb_bug12902967.

    MDEV-6689: valgrind errors in view.test in 10.1

    SHOW COLUMNS and SHOW KEYS commands fill IS_table_read_plan
    in a special way - they don't set or use lookup_field_vals
    member.

    Added a ""trivial_show_command"" flag that signals that
    lookup_field_vals has no valid data, made EXPLAIN code honor it.

    Verified that current 5.5-galera is not affected and added test case
    to regression set.

    MDEV-6657: Poor plan choice for ORDER BY key DESC optimization...

    The problem was caused by the following scenario:
    - range optimizer picks an index IDX1 which doesn't match the ORDER BY ...
      LIMIT clause.
    - test_if_skip_sort_order() decides to switch to index IDX2 which matches
      the ORDER BY ... LIMIT.
    - it runs SQL_SELECT::test_quick_select() for the second time to produce
      an quick select for IDX2.
    - However, test_quick_select() would figure that full index scan on IDX1
      is still cheaper (its calculations ignore the LIMIT n).

    Fixed this by
    - passing force_quick_range=true to test_quick_select()
    - in test_quick_select, don't consider full index scans if the mentioned
      parameter is true.

    Numerous changes in .result files are caused by test_quick_select() being
    run after ""early/late NULLs filtering"" feature has injected NOT NULL
    condition.

    MDEV-6384: It seems like OPTIMIZER take into account the order of indexes in the table

    When ORDER BY ... LIMIT check whether it should switch from index IDX1
    to index IDX2, it should not ignore the fact that IDX2 may have a
    potential range or ref(const) access.
    Istead, it should calculate their costs: there is now a saved range
    optimizer cost and code to re-calculate what best_access_path()
    calculated for ref(const).

    /* in current cost model these two can be very different
    numbers unfortunately */

    MDEV-6480: Remove conditions for which range optimizer returned SEL_ARG::IMPOSSIBLE

    Let range optimizer remove parts of OR-clauses for which range analysis
    produced SEL_TREE(IMPOSSIBLE).
    There is no need to remove parts of AND-clauses: either they are inside
    of OR (and the whole AND-clause will be removed), or the AND-clause is
    at the top level, in which case the whole WHERE (or ON) is always FALSE
    and this is a degenerate case which receives special treatment.

    The removal process takes care not to produce 1-way ORs (in that case
    we substitute the OR for its remaining member).

    Made sql_log_slow a session variable

    mysqldump:
    - Added --log-queries to allow one to disable logging for the dump

    sql/log_event.cc:
    - Removed setting of enable_slow_log as it's not required anymore.

    sql/sql_parse.cc:
    - Set enable_slow_log to value of thd->variables.sql_log_slow as this will speed up tests if slow log is disabled.
    - opt_log_slow_admin_statements can now only disable slow log, not enable it.

    sql/sql_explain.cc:
    - Minor cleanup

    Other things:
    - Added sql_log_slow to system variables.
    - Changed opt_slow_log to global_system_variables.sql_log_slow in all files
    - Updated tests to reflect changes

    A donor node does a flush tables and then tries to

    However, innodb_disallow_writes was missing in xtradb.
    Merged 'InnodbFreeze' patch from maria-5.5-galera's to
    xtradb. Also, merged some changes missing in innobase's
    os0file.cc.

    Added a basic test case for innodb_disallow_writes system

    Analysis: innodb_compression_algorithm is a global variable and
    can change while we are building page compressed page. This could
    lead page corruption.

    Fix: Cache innodb_compression_algorithm on local variable before
    doing any compression or page formating to avoid concurrent
    change. Improved page verification on debug builds.

    Fiix random test failures on fil_decompress_page_2 function.

    Analysis: InnoDB writes also files that do not contain FIL-header.
    This could lead incorrect analysis on os_fil_read_func function
    when it tries to see is page page compressed based on FIL_PAGE_TYPE
    field on FIL-header. With bad luck uncompressed page that does
    not contain FIL-headed, the byte on FIL_PAGE_TYPE position could
    indicate that page is page comrpessed.

    Fix: Upper layer must indicate is file space page compressed
    or not. If this is not yet known, we need to read the FIL-header
    and find it out. Files that we know that are not page compressed
    we can always just provide FALSE.

    The variables' ON_CHECK functions relied on set_var's ""value""
    member, which is NULL for SET ... =default. Fixed by using
    save_result instead.

    Also, for many wsrep variables, pointers to their respective
    global variables were used to provide default values. The patch
    fixes this by using appropriate macros and string literals.

    MDEV-6376: InnoDB: Assertion failure in thread 139995225970432
    in file buf0mtflu.cc line 570.

    Analysis: Real timing bug, we should take the mutex before we
    try to send those shutdown messages, that would make sure
    that threads doing a unfinished flush (they have acquired
    this mutex) have time to do their work before we add shutdown
    messages to work queue. Currently, we just add those shutdown
    messages to work queue and code assumes that at flush, there
    is constant number of items to be processed and thus
    leading to assertion.

    * Support conditionally disabled plugins - keyword ONLY_IF
    * Use ONLY_IF for conditionally skipping plugins, instead of
      doing MYSQL_ADD_PLUGIN conditionally as before. Because if
      MYSQL_ADD_PLUGIN isn't done at all, PLUGIN_xxx=YES cannot work.

    additional dependencies (lz4, lzo) for our packages just yet.
    This can (and will) be reconsidered, and this test can (and will)
    be updated again.

    MDEV#6316: Fix mysqldump SST method to transfer binlog
    state to the joiner

    In mysqldump SST, if Galera nodes are started with --log-bin and
    -log-slave-updates, the GTID sequence increases as the dump is
    played on the joiner, leaving behind the donor.

    This patch introduces a new mysqldump option --galera-sst-mode,
    which if enabled, would

    a) Add command to set off binary logging (log_bin=OFF).
    b) Add command to set @@global.gtid_binlog_state to that
       of donor.

    This will help in keeping the GTIDs consistent post-SST across
    the nodes.

    MDEV#6296: runtime adjustment of wsrep_slave_threads creates
    threads but never removes them

    When wsrep_slave_threads is changed at runtime, the old ""change""
    value is not taken into account and thus successive SETs can
    make wsrep_slave_threads value inconsistent with the actual
    number of applier threads present.

    Adapt default_tmp_storage_engine implementation from mysql-5.6
    New feature (as compared to 5.6), default_tmp_storage_engine=NULL
    means that temporary tables will use default_storage_engine value.
    This makes the behavior backward compatible.

    still only <= 16K page size. Note that single row size must be
    still <= 16K and max key length is not affected.

    MDEV#5942 (Issue 1), MDEV#5903

    Updated MYSQL_ADD_PLUGIN cmake macro so that for wsrep
    builds (WITH_WSREP), components not specified explicitly
    under CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL does not get packaged. This is
    to avoid generation of extra packages for wsrep (galera)
    build.

    MDEV#6206: wsrep_slave_threads subtracts from max_connections

    Decoupled wsrep thread count from connection count. By doing so,
    the number of wsrep threads (applier/rollbacker) would no longer
    affect the threads_connected status variable and thus maximum
    allowable user connections limit would be @@max_connections.

    Also introduced a new status variable 'wsrep_thread_count' to hold
    the number of wsrep applier/rollbacker threads.

    Added a test case.

    MDEV-6070: FusionIO: Failure to create a table with ATOMIC_WRITES
    option leaves the database in inconsistent state,

    Analysis: Problem was that atomic writes variable had incorrect
    type on same places leading to fact that e.g. OFF option was
    not regognized. Furthermore, some error check code was missing
    from both InnoDB and XtraDB engines. Finally, when table is
    created we have already created the .ibd file and if we can't
    set atomic writes it stays there.

    Fix: Fix atomic writes variable type to ulint as it should be.
    Fix: Add proper error code checking on os errors on both InnoDB
    and XtraDB
    Fix: Remove the .idb file when atomic writes can't be enabled
    to a new table.

    Fix bug https://code.launchpad.net/~laurynas-biveinis/percona-server/bug1295268
      (Inadequate background LRU flushing for write workloads with InnoDB compression).

        If InnoDB compression is used and the workload has writes, the
        following situation is possible. The LRU flusher issues an LRU flush
        request for an instance.  buf_do_LRU_batch decides to perform
        unzip_LRU eviction and this eviction might fully satisfy the
        request. Then buf_flush_LRU_tail checks the number of flushed pages in
        the last iteration, finds it to be zero, and wrongly decides not to
        flush that instance anymore.

        Fixed by maintaining unzip_LRU eviction counter in struct
        flush_counter_t variables, and checking it in buf_flush_LRU_tail when
        deciding whether to stop flushing the current instance.

        Fix provided by: Laurynas Biveinis (Percona)

    Added test cases for new configuration files to get mysql-test-run suite sys_vars
    to pass. Fix some small errors.

    Earlier all pages were compressed and this provided best performance and

    Fixed hang seen on TPC-C measure phase. We should not use timedwait on threads
    waiting for a job. They should sleep and let other threads to their work. At
    shutdown, we know that we put ""work"" and that is handled as soon as possible.

    MDEV#5534: mysql_tzinfo_to_sql generates wrong query

    mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tries to set wsrep_replicate_myisam
    as SESSION variable, while its a GLOBAL-only system variable,
    and thus the resulting sql would fail to load.

    Fixed by changing the scope to GLOBAL in the SET command.

    Also added following include files to facilitate testing :
    * include/have_wsrep.inc
    * include/not_wsrep.inc
    * include/have_wsrep_enabled.inc

    MDEV-5644: Assertion failure during lock_cancel_waiting_and_release.

    Analysis: In wsrep case there is two transactions possible trx and
    conflicting lock owning transaction. Code was handling trx mutexin
    correctly but not for c_lock->trx case.

    Fixed by taking clock-trx mutex when needed and releasing trx
    mutex if it is taken at lower levels.

    Enhancement: Change atomic_writes table option to enum type. Now every file can either use atomic writes, not use it or use default.

    SYNTAX: ATOMIC_WRITES=['DEFAULT','ON','OFF']

    Idea here is to be able to define innodb_doublewrite = 1 but with following rules:

    ATOMIC_WRITES='DEFAULT' - if innodb_use_atomic_writes = 1, we do not write to doublewrite buffer the changes
                              if innodb_use_atomic_writes = 0, we write to doublewrite buffer
    ATOMIC_WRITES='ON'      - do not write to doublewrite buffer
    ATOMIC_WRITES='OFF'     - write to doublewrite buffer

    Note that doublewrite buffer can't be used if innodb_doublewrite = 0.

    Feature: In first write if we trim we set write_size to actual bytes
    written and rest of the page is trimmed. In following writes
    there is no need to trim again if write_size only increases
    because rest of the page is already trimmed. If actual write
    size decreases we need to trim again. Need to research if this
    can happen frequently enough to make any effect.

commit e80f2468b468540c27e9b7174769262297bffc13
Author: Jan Lindström <jplindst@mariadb.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 9 08:30:09 2014 +0200

    Fixed issues with atomic writes and compressed pages.

    Temporal solution: In directFS using atomic writes
    we must use posix_fallocate to extend the file because
    pwrite past end of file fails but when compression is
    used the file pages must be physically initialized with
    zeroes, thus after file extend with posix_fallocate
    we still write empty pages to file.

Date:   Fri Dec 20 08:59:34 2013 +0200

    Temporally disable posix_fallocate on os_file_set_size because
    currently Fusion-io SSD drive does not support setting file
    size without fysically writing pages with zeroes when fallocate
    with PUCH_HOLE is used.

    Added additional error message if atomic write setup does not
    succeed.

    MDEV#5407, MDEV#5386, MVED#4222

    Problem: As, wsrep_provider is dynamic and can accept
    a valid provider while server is running. Patch for
    #4222 wrongly skips the initialization of binlog plugin
    during server start, when wsrep provider is not specified.

    In wsrep build, if opt_log_bin is not provided, we still
    init binlog with wsrep_emulate_bin_log ON.

    Fix: This patch fixes #4222 by adding a check to return
    from binlog_savepoint_set without proceeding further if
    wsrep_on is OFF/false.

    This patch also fixes MDEV#5407 and reverts changes pushed
    for MDEV#5386 (no longer valid).

    MDEV-5408: Crash in mariadb-wsrep during plugin load at startup

    Analysis: If wsrep_provider is not specified (""none"") the wsrep is not
    initialized.

    Fix: Add additional guard not to call wsrep->post_rollback if
    wsrep_provider is not specified.

    MDEV-5386: Server crashes in thd_get_ha_data on maria-5.5-galera tree while running 'check testcase before test

    Analysis: In Galera binlog is not enabled by default in case
    when wsrep provider is not specified. In this case we should
    not call thd->binlog_flush_pending_rows_event(TRUE).

    Fix: Added a additional guard on galera not to call binlog
    function if wsrep provider is not specified and binlog is
    not enabled.

    MDEV-443: Galera: Server crashes on flushing tables for SST if started with character_set_server utf16 or utf32 or ucs2, and with wsrep_sst_method=rsync

    Analysis: In SST Galera directly calls parser using current client character
    set. Similarly in BF Galera uses client character set to apply. However,
    there are character sets that are not currently supported by the parser.

    Fix: If currenct client character set is one of those that is not supported
    by the parser, temporally set character set to latin1 before we enter
    parser and restore it after we have parsed.

    Fixed additional problem with kernel_mutex. Kernel mutex is also
    held on lock_rec_other_has_conflicting that will also call (eventually)
    wsrep_innobase_kill_one_trx. Added a new parameter have_kernel_mutex
    to mark do we already own kernel mutex or not.

    MDEV-4227: Galera server should stop crashing on setting binlog_format STATEMENT

    Analysis: Currently you can set binlog_format to STATEMENT or MIXED
    even when they are not really supported by galera.

    Fix: Produce an error message if binlog_format is set to STATEMENT
    or MIXED and wsrep_on = ON. Added a test case for this.

    MDEV#4138: Galera: mysqld_safe doesn't pass on wsrep_provider to mysqld

    In mysqld_safe script, during the processing of command line
    options, the supplied wsrep_provider option was not getting
    appended to the set of mysqld options. Hence, wsrep plugin
    would never receive the path for wsrep provider.

    Fixed by adding logic to append the wsrep_provider option
    to the set of mysqld options.

    MDEV#4109: Galera: Valgrind warnings ""blocks are still
               reachable"" in wsrep_init_startup on MTR tests

    The initialization & de-initialization of wsrep plugin is solely
    controlled by wsrep_on system variable. Now, as wsrep_on is ON by
    default, the plugin gets initialized during server start. However,
    there would be a leakage in case wsrep_on is turned off before plugin's
    deinitialization (while server is shutting down) takes place, in which
    case the deinit routine will not be invoked.

    In this particular case, wsrep_on is turned off as no wsrep provider
    has been specified & thus the valgrind warnings.

    Fixed by introducing a flag which tracks and now controls the
    (de|)initialization of the wsrep plugin instead on wsrep_on.
    Added necessary asserts.

    main.connect                             [ pass ]  16534
    valgrind_report                          [ pass ]

    MDEV-4222: Assertion `( ((global_system_variables.wsrep_on) &&
      (thd && thd->variables.wsrep_on)) && wsrep_emulate_bin_log) ||
      mysql_bin_log .is_open()' fails on SAVEPOINT with disabled
      wsrep_provider

    As wsrep_on system variable is ON by default the binlog handlerton
    is implicitly enabled during the server initialization phase. Later,
    while wsrep plugin is getting initialized, wsrep_on in corrected &
    turned OFF in case wsrep provider is not specified (leaving binlog
    in ON state!). This leads to the reported assertion.

    Fixed by adding another check for wsrep provider before binlog
    is enabled.

    Added a test case.

    MDEV-4235: Galera: Assertion `0' fails in tdc_remove_table on creating a trigger

    Analysis: There is two different THD's using the same table.

    Fix: In galera brute force (BF) exclusive locks are cancelled. Thus other threads
    could access the same table. Added additional check if this is the case, then we
    should not assert here.

    Analysis: Code acquired kernel_mutex when calling wsrep_innobase_kill_one_trx.
    However, functions below also might take kernel mutex thus the assertion.

    Fix: Acquire kernel_mutex only for lock_cancel_waiting_and_release where
    it is really needed.

    MDEV-4233: Galera: assertion: (lock->trx)->wait_lock == lock fails in file lock0lock.c line 796

    Analysis: Assertion means that InnoDB transaction lock queue is not
    correctly set. Reason seams to be the fact that wrong lock is cancelled.

    Fix: We have selected c_lock to be cancelled. Thus we should cancel
    and release lock that is waiting for this lock i.e. c_lock->trx->wait_lock.

    MDEV-507 deb/rpm packages for galera builds.
            Debian packaging, part II.
            Changes in the set of package-related files. Some were removed, some renamed,
            as we only keep the mariadb-galera-server package.

Author: Alexey Botchkov <holyfoot@askmonty.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 18 18:07:02 2012 +0400

    MDEV 507 deb/rpm packages for galera builds.
            Debian/Ubuntu packages fixed.
            The mariadb-server-5.5 and mariadb-server packages became
            mariadb-galera-server-5.5 and mariadb-galera-server respectively.
            The rest of packages are removed from the build.
            This patch reflects only files that were changed.
            Second part of this patch has only file renaming/deletions.

* docs(rate-limiting-advanced) add 0.36 changes

- Add global rate limits by service. If plugin is applied globally, it will have a different counter per service, all with the same rate limit. If plugin is applied per service, then it can be configured on each service.

- Add rate limits by arbitrary headers. The user defines a `config.identifier.header` identifier and also a `config.header_name` name to set up rate limiting by any given header name.

* docs(1.1.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.1

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two deviations from that:

* Modified some header levels
* The section `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` did not exist
  in the `UPGRADE.md` document - I left that part, since there's a
  1.1.0 release and a 1.1.1 release.

* docs(1.2.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.2

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two major deviations from that file:
* I changed several header levels
* The `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` section does not exist in
  UPGRADE.md, but I have left it here.

* docs(1.3.x) add upgrading.md instructions for 1.3.x (#1437)

Most changes from this commit are a straight replacement of the
text using https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/next/UPGRADE.md .

* chore(ee/*) remove leftover frontmatter

* Update index.md

* Add Certificate Authority documenation (#1467)

* docs(hub) add CA certificate creation to mTLS docs

Add instructions on creating CA certificates to the mTLS plugin
documentation, as creating CA certificates is required to use mTLS.

* docs(admin) add CAs to Admin API

Add Certificate Authorities to the admin API documentation. No
equivalent for core as mTLS (the only current use case for Certificate
Authorities) is not available in core.

Additionally fix a rendering error in the 0.35 document.

* fix(admin) remove extra admin API document.

app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api.md appears to have been superseded by
app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api/index.md. Later versions' doc trees only
have the latter variant. Deleting it as such.

* docs(oidc) fix spelling and grammar for Okta

* docs(oidc) use sub for Okta consumer_claim

Change the consumer_claim from oid to sub for Okta. The original source
for this doc was the Azure guide, but Azure is the odd IDP out whose sub
claim values can't easily be used with our OIDC implementation, since
there's no way to know the correct value in advance of a sign-in
attempt.

* fix(proxy) describe actual router rule order (#1473)

Fix proxy router rule evaluation order documentation for newer versions.
The router has evaluated regex path rules before prefix path rules for
some time, and documentation has always stated the reverse. This applies
to older versions also, but has not been updated there for the sake of
time.

Add some additional example information for route shadowing.

Correct broken anchor link.

Made some minor phrasing changes.

Since this has been the case since the first version in the PDK, this change updates thes fields manually (they are usually auto-generated, but the tags for the versions are fixed and can't be changed in order to auto-generate them correctly).

- Add global rate limits by service. If plugin is applied globally, it will have a different counter per service, all with the same rate limit. If plugin is applied per service, then it can be configured on each service.

- Add rate limits by arbitrary headers. The user defines a `config.identifier.header` identifier and also a `config.header_name` name to set up rate limiting by any given header name.

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two deviations from that:

* Modified some header levels
* The section `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` did not exist
  in the `UPGRADE.md` document - I left that part, since there's a
  1.1.0 release and a 1.1.1 release.

* docs(1.2.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.2

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two major deviations from that file:
* I changed several header levels
* The `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` section does not exist in
  UPGRADE.md, but I have left it here.

* Update index.md

* Add Certificate Authority documenation (#1467)

* docs(hub) add CA certificate creation to mTLS docs

Add instructions on creating CA certificates to the mTLS plugin
documentation, as creating CA certificates is required to use mTLS.

* docs(admin) add CAs to Admin API

Add Certificate Authorities to the admin API documentation. No
equivalent for core as mTLS (the only current use case for Certificate
Authorities) is not available in core.

Additionally fix a rendering error in the 0.35 document.

* fix(admin) remove extra admin API document.

app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api.md appears to have been superseded by
app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api/index.md. Later versions' doc trees only
have the latter variant. Deleting it as such.

* docs(oidc) use sub for Okta consumer_claim

Change the consumer_claim from oid to sub for Okta. The original source
for this doc was the Azure guide, but Azure is the odd IDP out whose sub
claim values can't easily be used with our OIDC implementation, since
there's no way to know the correct value in advance of a sign-in
attempt.

* fix(proxy) describe actual router rule order (#1473)

Fix proxy router rule evaluation order documentation for newer versions.
The router has evaluated regex path rules before prefix path rules for

to older versions also, but has not been updated there for the sake of
time.

Add some additional example information for route shadowing.

Correct broken anchor link.

Made some minor phrasing changes.

- Add global rate limits by service. If plugin is applied globally, it will have a different counter per service, all with the same rate limit. If plugin is applied per service, then it can be configured on each service.

- Add rate limits by arbitrary headers. The user defines a `config.identifier.header` identifier and also a `config.header_name` name to set up rate limiting by any given header name.

* docs(1.1.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.1

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two deviations from that:

* Modified some header levels
* The section `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` did not exist
  in the `UPGRADE.md` document - I left that part, since there's a
  1.1.0 release and a 1.1.1 release.

* docs(1.2.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.2

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two major deviations from that file:
* I changed several header levels
* The `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` section does not exist in
  UPGRADE.md, but I have left it here.

* docs(1.3.x) add upgrading.md instructions for 1.3.x (#1437)

Most changes from this commit are a straight replacement of the
text using https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/next/UPGRADE.md .

* chore(ee/*) remove leftover frontmatter

* Update index.md

* Add Certificate Authority documenation (#1467)

* docs(hub) add CA certificate creation to mTLS docs

Add instructions on creating CA certificates to the mTLS plugin
documentation, as creating CA certificates is required to use mTLS.

* docs(admin) add CAs to Admin API

Add Certificate Authorities to the admin API documentation. No
equivalent for core as mTLS (the only current use case for Certificate
Authorities) is not available in core.

Additionally fix a rendering error in the 0.35 document.

* fix(admin) remove extra admin API document.

app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api.md appears to have been superseded by
app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api/index.md. Later versions' doc trees only
have the latter variant. Deleting it as such.

* docs(oidc) use sub for Okta consumer_claim

Change the consumer_claim from oid to sub for Okta. The original source
for this doc was the Azure guide, but Azure is the odd IDP out whose sub
claim values can't easily be used with our OIDC implementation, since
there's no way to know the correct value in advance of a sign-in
attempt.

* fix(proxy) describe actual router rule order (#1473)

Fix proxy router rule evaluation order documentation for newer versions.
The router has evaluated regex path rules before prefix path rules for
some time, and documentation has always stated the reverse. This applies
to older versions also, but has not been updated there for the sake of
time.

Add some additional example information for route shadowing.

Correct broken anchor link.

Made some minor phrasing changes.

- Add global rate limits by service. If plugin is applied globally, it will have a different counter per service, all with the same rate limit. If plugin is applied per service, then it can be configured on each service.

- Add rate limits by arbitrary headers. The user defines a `config.identifier.header` identifier and also a `config.header_name` name to set up rate limiting by any given header name.

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this

https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two deviations from that:

* Modified some header levels
* The section `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` did not exist
  in the `UPGRADE.md` document - I left that part, since there's a

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this

* docs(1.3.x) add upgrading.md instructions for 1.3.x (#1437)

Most changes from this commit are a straight replacement of the
text using https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/next/UPGRADE.md .

* Update index.md

* Add Certificate Authority documenation (#1467)

* docs(hub) add CA certificate creation to mTLS docs

Add instructions on creating CA certificates to the mTLS plugin
documentation, as creating CA certificates is required to use mTLS.

* docs(admin) add CAs to Admin API

Add Certificate Authorities to the admin API documentation. No
equivalent for core as mTLS (the only current use case for Certificate
Authorities) is not available in core.

Additionally fix a rendering error in the 0.35 document.

* fix(admin) remove extra admin API document.

app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api.md appears to have been superseded by
app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api/index.md. Later versions' doc trees only
have the latter variant. Deleting it as such.

for this doc was the Azure guide, but Azure is the odd IDP out whose sub
claim values can't easily be used with our OIDC implementation, since
there's no way to know the correct value in advance of a sign-in
attempt.

* fix(proxy) describe actual router rule order (#1473)

Fix proxy router rule evaluation order documentation for newer versions.
The router has evaluated regex path rules before prefix path rules for

to older versions also, but has not been updated there for the sake of
time.

Add some additional example information for route shadowing.

Correct broken anchor link.

Made some minor phrasing changes.

- Add global rate limits by service. If plugin is applied globally, it will have a different counter per service, all with the same rate limit. If plugin is applied per service, then it can be configured on each service.

- Add rate limits by arbitrary headers. The user defines a `config.identifier.header` identifier and also a `config.header_name` name to set up rate limiting by any given header name.

* docs(1.1.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.1

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two deviations from that:

* Modified some header levels
* The section `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` did not exist
  in the `UPGRADE.md` document - I left that part, since there's a
  1.1.0 release and a 1.1.1 release.

* docs(1.2.x) update upgrading.md file for Kong 1.2

This change basically involves replacing most of the text on this
page with the relevant section in
https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md.

There are two major deviations from that file:
* I changed several header levels
* The `Upgrade Path for Patch Releases` section does not exist in
  UPGRADE.md, but I have left it here.

* docs(1.3.x) add upgrading.md instructions for 1.3.x (#1437)

Most changes from this commit are a straight replacement of the
text using https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/next/UPGRADE.md .

* Update index.md

* Add Certificate Authority documenation (#1467)

* docs(hub) add CA certificate creation to mTLS docs

Add instructions on creating CA certificates to the mTLS plugin
documentation, as creating CA certificates is required to use mTLS.

* docs(admin) add CAs to Admin API

Add Certificate Authorities to the admin API documentation. No
equivalent for core as mTLS (the only current use case for Certificate
Authorities) is not available in core.

Additionally fix a rendering error in the 0.35 document.

* fix(admin) remove extra admin API document.

app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api.md appears to have been superseded by
app/enterprise/0.35-x/admin-api/index.md. Later versions' doc trees only
have the latter variant. Deleting it as such.

* docs(oidc) use sub for Okta consumer_claim

Change the consumer_claim from oid to sub for Okta. The original source
for this doc was the Azure guide, but Azure is the odd IDP out whose sub
claim values can't easily be used with our OIDC implementation, since
there's no way to know the correct value in advance of a sign-in
attempt.

* fix(proxy) describe actual router rule order (#1473)

Fix proxy router rule evaluation order documentation for newer versions.
The router has evaluated regex path rules before prefix path rules for
some time, and documentation has always stated the reverse. This applies
to older versions also, but has not been updated there for the sake of
time.

Add some additional example information for route shadowing.

Correct broken anchor link.

Made some minor phrasing changes.

","Prevent duplicate security creation

Since securities are created AND THEN added to the algorithm, it was
possible for two different universes to create the SAME security at
the same time step. This led to two different Security instances and
only one of them being added. Ironically, it appears that it was a last
in wins situation.

This change aims to track securities that are created by a universe in a
given time step and re-use the already created security. A more holistic
solution here may be to encapsulate the creation/fetching of securities
into a new type and then ensure we use that abstraction everywhere, but
this would have led to many more changes.

This reverts commit dfa717d2399206fe04d705e6777a3a16d46777b5.

Original commit changed the attribute of the fixed package used for version comparison from epoch-less to fully qualified version. This change was prompted by a CVE in ubuntu namespace that was not matched correctly - its a case where installed package has a non-0 epoch but the epoch on the fixed version is ignored and assumed to be 0. While the original commit fixes this issue in ubuntu namespace, it has the opposite effect in RHEL based distros. Epoch is not gathered/stored for RHEL packages. To complicate the issue, a significant portion of fixed versions in RHEL have non-0 epochs. In combination with the original commit this would result in not matching CVEs correctly, hence the revert. The following changes are required in order to fix all of this correctly
1. Change analyzers to gather epoch information if available
2. Undo this revert and put back the original commit
3. Additionally update the version comparators to drop non-0 epoch on fixed versions if the installed version has no epoch information

This reverts commit 63279823a77320b8cdf7f69d61af6eddaa5ebf33.

Flawed on many levels

* Adds poor API to a public function
* Papers over the fact that the public function is doing something bad
  by catching exceptions it cannot handle in the first place
* Papers over the real cause of the issue which is a bug in the timeout
  decorator
* Doesn't reraise properly
* Catches the wrong exception

Fixes #49824
Fixes #49817

* Make the timeout decorator properly raise an exception outside of the function's scope

signal handlers which raise exceptions will never work well because the
exception can be raised anywhere in the called code.  This leads to
exception race conditions where the exceptions could end up being
hanlded by unintended pieces of the called code.

The timeout decorator was using just that idiom.  It was especially bad
because the decorator syntactically occurs outside of the called code
but because of the signal handler, the exception was being raised inside
of the called code.

This change uses a thread instead of a signal to manage the timeout in
parallel to the execution of the decorated function.  Since raising of
the exception happens inside of the decorator, now, instead of inside of
a signal handler, the timeout exception is raised from outside of the
called code as expected which makes reasoning about where exceptions are
to be expected intuitive again.

Fixes #43884

* Add a common case test.

Adding an integration test driven from our unittests.  Most of the time
we'll timeout in run_command which is running things in a subprocess.
Create a test for that specific case in case anything funky comes up
between threading and execve.

* Don't use OSError-based TimeoutError as a base class

Unlike most standard exceptions, OSError has a specific parameter list
with specific meanings.  Instead follow the example of other stdlib
functions, concurrent.futures and multiprocessing and define a separate
TimeoutException.

* Add comment and docstring to point out that this is not hte Python3 TimeoutError","allow caller to deal with timeout (#49449)

* allow caller to deal with timeout

  a start for #43884 and timeout issues in long operations

","Fix Foxx security (#9020)

* Unbreak aardvark when --foxx.api false

The easiest way to disable the aardvark foxx routes is to just skip the
import and mount altogether. The previous approach caused the service to
throw an error because the module doesn't actually export anything.
There's no need to prevent the export if we just don't import the module
to begin with.

* Add an error code for service api disabled

* Throw an actual error when accessing Foxx API routes

* Throw an error when using legacy Foxx API

There's no easy way to use a catch-all here so disable them one by one. No new routes will be added to this API and it'll go away in 4.0 so there's no risk of forgetting to add the throw-check in new routes.

* Hide Foxx services in frontend if Foxx API is disabled

* Render subnav without delay

The subnav doesn't need the perm check results but we need the subnav to exist so we can populate it in other parts of the app. This fixes the subnav not showing up when reloading certain views (e.g. install service via upload).

* Hide ONLY the Foxx store when it is disabled

We still want to allow installing and upgrading/replacing services. We just don't want to show the store.

* Build aardvark

* Remove password from stringified outputs (#2066)

* Remove password from stringified outputs

Theres a security concern where if you're not careful and you include your client or pool instance in console.log or stack traces it might include the database password.  To widen the pit of success I'm making that field non-enumerable.  You can still get at it...it just wont show up ""by accident"" when you're logging things now.

The backwards compatiblity impact of this is very small, but it is still technically somewhat an API change so...8.0.

* Implement feedback

* Fix more whitespace the autoformatter changed

* Simplify code a bit

* Remove password from stringified outputs (#2070)

* Keep ConnectionParameters’s password property writable

`Client` writes to it when `password` is a function.

* Avoid creating password property on pool options

when it didn’t exist previously.

* Allow password option to be non-enumerable

to avoid breaking uses like `new Pool(existingPool.options)`.

* Make password property definitions consistent

in formatting and configurability.

* Make `native` non-enumerable (#2065)

* Make `native` non-enumerable

Making it non-enumerable means less spurious ""Cannot find module""
errors in your logs when iterating over `pg` objects.

`Object.defineProperty` has been available since Node 0.12.

See https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/1894#issuecomment-543300178

* Continue support for creating a pg.Pool from another instance’s options (#2076)

* Add failing test for creating a `BoundPool` from another instance’s settings

* Continue support for creating a pg.Pool from another instance’s options

by dropping the requirement for the `password` property to be enumerable.

* Use user name as default database when user is non-default (#1679)

Not entirely backwards-compatible.

* Make native client password property consistent with others

i.e. configurable.

* Make notice messages not an instance of Error (#2090)

* Make notice messages not an instance of Error

Slight API cleanup to make a notice instance the same shape as it was, but not be an instance of error.  This is a backwards incompatible change though I expect the impact to be minimal.

Closes #1982

* skip notice test in travis

* Pin node@13.6 for regression in async iterators

* Check and see if node 13.8 is still borked on async iterator

* Yeah, node still has changed edge case behavior on stream

* Emit notice messages on travis

","Add --enable-automation flag in GetFromBrowserOptions()

crrev.com/c/956654 introduced the bad flags warning of ""stability and
security will suffer"" for Android.
This change caused parformance regressions because a bad flag
""--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list"" is used for perfomance testing.
(crbug.com/822258#c13)
So crrev.com/c/965727 introduces the check of ""--enable-automation"" flag in ShowBadFlagsPrompt().
(This check already exists in startup_browser_creator_impl.cc for Desktop not
to show the infobar during performance tests.)

This CL adds the flag to GetFromBrowserOptions().

This reverts commit e29c70f604f53b015da7877e3750da9756f8cb37.

Reason for revert: This CL is likely the cause of a tree closure for failing to compile in build ios-device (https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/ios-device/173021)

","feat: detect support for MTE and BTI

MTE and BTI are Armv8.5-A features which help memory safety and
control-flow integrity. This CL adds support for detecting them
using the AT_HWCAP2 Linux API.

MTE contains new instructions which will crash older cores. base::CPU
can now be used to tell whether these instructions are safe to
execute and adds a test to verify this. This does not test whether
MTE is configured correctly to give any security properties, a
subsequent CL will add tests for this.

","NativeIO: Add Error Handling for file errors

This CL adds a mechanism to report file errors, as reported by
base::File::Error, though DOMExceptions. Due to security and privacy
considerations, not all errors are exposed to the user. For those
operations performed by the browser process (open, rename), the exact
error type is not exposed to the renderer.

Errors that are not reported by base::File::Error are left unchanged and

","blink: Bring SecurityOrigin port=0 handling in line with //url

SecurityOrigin currently returns identical objects when constructed from
KURLs with ports explicitly set to 0 and KURLs with ports equal to their
schemes' defaults. This is inconsistent with the //url implementation
(and the HTML spec!).

This CL makes two changes to ensure that
  AreSameOrigin(KURL(""https://a.com:0""), KURL(""https://a.com""))
starts returning false.

(1)  It updates SecurityOrigin(KURL) to set the origin's ""effective
port"" field to the given URL's protocol's default port when the URL's
parsed port is empty.
(2)  It updates SecurityOrigin::IsSameOriginWith to use
SecurityOrigin::effective_port_ for comparison rather than
SecurityOrigin::port_.

(SecurityOrigin::effective_port_ and SecurityOrigin::port_ differ in
that `effective_port_` takes into account empty/default ports, and
`port_` doesn't; prior to this change, `effective_port_` was being
initialized incorrectly to the default port for SecurityOrigins
constructed from URLs with port explicitly set to 0.)

This CL adds serialization behavior for port-0 origins that is incorrect
but matches url::Origin's. Port-0 origins' serializations should include
the port, but they currently don't (crbug.com/1136966). A subsequent
change will implement this fix for both SecurityOrigin and url::Origin.
(Doing one at a time is tricky because some tests check equality of
origins' serializations.)

Test: Adds unit tests covering same-originness and effective_port_.

","Convert from storing lowest BrowsingInstanceID to keeping all in a set.

At present ChildProcessSecurityPolicyImpl::SecurityState stores only a
single BrowsingInstanceID (the lowest) even though its associated
process may contain multiple BrowsingInstances. This may lead
CanAccessDataForOrigin to consider the wrong BrowsingInstance when
performing its checks for opt-in isolated origins.

This CL converts SecurityState to track an ordered set of all the
BrowsingInstanceIDs so that they can all be checked.
CanAccessDataForOrigin is modified to return 'true' if *any*
BrowsingInstance in the set would allow the access, otherwise it returns
'false', and logs the failure reasons for each of the BrowsingInstances.

This CL also includes delayed cleanup of BrowsingInstance state from
ChildProcessSecurityPolicy when BrowsingInstances are deleted. This
avoids memory leaks but may pose a small risk of renderer kills. We will
monitor the CanAccessDataForOrigin crash keys to see if such cases
occur in practice.

- require a transient user activation on the browser side, and consume
it when showing the eye dropper for the renderer (this will prevent a

- require the eye dropper UI to be visible for a minimum amount of time

There is also a fix for the popup not correctly updating the user

The animation to enter fullscreen makes the Incognito badge next to the
security icon appear as if it comes from the left. The animation to enter
fullscreen makes icons on the far right (Share icon/ Mic icon) and left
(Message badge/ Incognito badge) move towards the center before fading out

This reverts commit bfe52a912bf0a06961b2c64037008b6569940d93.

Reason for revert: The Chrome security team has prohibited the use of gRPC in its current state as it does not go through Chrome's network stack. The Cloud Speech-to-Text implementation will be replaced with an alternative REST-based API that goes through the network stack.

2. The license text was changed to align with Chromium conventions.

3. any.proto and status.proto were renamed to prevent conflict with

This reverts commit 05cdf7552ded731b0156bc7c25ece2fbb88bf1ff after
fixing flaky tests by removing sanity-check of unblocked image.
It is likely that the image has not completed loading before the
DistilledPageObserver returns. A future change will add the
sanity-check image back in, but it is not necessary for testing
whether Reader Mode is loading insecure/mixed content, so relanding
with it in a TODO for now.

","fido: disable caBLE if the BLE adapter does not support advertising

On Windows, some Bluetooth adapters do not support advertisements. When
discovering such an adapter, treat Bluetooth as unavailable during a
caBLEv1 request.

caBLEv1 relies on the client broadcasting an advertisement, and there
isn't much use in trying that if the adapter doesn't support it.

For requests where caBLE is the only permissible transport in the allow
list but Bluetooth is deemed unavailable, the WebAuthn UI automatically
advances to the ""Your device doesn't support this type of security key
error screen"".

","[iOS] Fix NTP presentation on bad ssl pages

This CL makes sure that we don't display the NTP if the loaded page is
an interstitial page.
This is caused by the behaviour of interstitial when the committed
interstitial feature isn't enabled. In that case the workflow is:
1. about:newtab is loaded
2. User loads bad.badssl.com
3. Navigation did start for bad.badssl.com
4. Navigation ends for bad.badssl.com
5. This is a bad ssl page so Chrome actually reverts to about:newtab
6. Load stops, but at this point the visible URL is about:newtab
7. The interstitial is displayed and the visible URL is updated to
   bad.badssl.com
8. The observers are notified through DidChangeVisibleSecurityState
9. No further callbacks

So the main issue is that there is not callback notifying that the
visible URL has changed.
This CL fixes it by adding a callback on DidChangeVisibleSecurityState
and also on LoadStop to avoid having the NTP flashing between 6 and 7.

This reverts commit 8458b988af7c630bf39335a68151a1ebd4c262e9, with
additional changes to address crashes/test failures from:
 crbug/1057744: CreateTraceWriter was occasionally failing, likely
                because the startup tracing timeout didn't reset the
                producer correctly. Fixed this issue.
 crbug/1057614: On windows, allocating the tracing SMB occasionally
                fails. This patch adds a workaround to handle such
                failures gracefully, disabling tracing for the process
                and calling DumpWithoutCrashing().
 crbug/1057896: Android ASAN failures for TracingControllerTests.
                Most TracingControllerTests were already disabled on
                android ASAN. Disabled the two new failing ones, too.

Reason for revert: Relanding and disabling tests / addressing crashes.

","perfetto: Switch to SMB-based startup tracing

Switch from StartupTraceWriter(Registry) and their thread-local buffers
to startup tracing using producer-supplied shared memory buffers. Each
ProducerClient allocates their own SMB now, which is provided to the
service when the ProducerClient connects.

With this new mechanism, we're aiming for simpler code with fewer race
conditions and hopefully fewer chances for data loss, see design doc
for details.

Note that this breaks startup tracing with the Perfetto system daemon.
At the moment, no tooling uses this, so we can probably remove support
for the time being. To add it back, we would have to:
 - start tracing with an SMB allocated by PosixSystemProducer. In
   sandboxed processes, we can allocate the SMB before the sandbox comes
   up, or later via mojo's broker (and then somehow plumb it through
   perfetto's IPC mechanism), or allocate it in the browser + pass an FD
   to it via the cmdline when spawning.
 - attempt to connect to the system service using this SMB.
 - bail out, stop and restart the session with a service-provided SMB if
   the system service doesn't support producer-provided SMBs (and thus
   fails to adopt the producer-provided SMB).

This reverts commit 0b623dbf44c99cf3119a9a1b281858317359b7f7.

Reason for revert: Still can't reproduce out of the bot.
Disabling the test with the proper feature flag so the flag can be
enabled on ToT since this has already launched (and the problem seems
test specific). Will work on fix for the test in a separate CL.
TBR-ing, since this is identical to the last reland, except using the
correct flag to disable test.

","Allow mixed-security content in promoted PWA windows

Prior to this CL, mixed-security content was blocked entirely in
standalone PWA windows with scopes. This CL allows those PWAs to display
mixed-security content, but when this happens, the window will show the
CustomTabBarView with the URL and a ""Not Secure"" indicator to indicate
the presence of mixed content.

Screenshot:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/attachment?aid=432401&signed_aid=JeW6cXlVCQ3bSebdZ-FoJg==&inline=1

This removes a behavioural difference between promoted PWAs and ""create
shortcut"" apps without manifest scopes.

","Turn off CFG when not needed

Control Flow Guard is a security feature that can help stop exploits. It
is primarily need on our official builds. On the debug and component
builds where Chromium is primarily developed it just adds a bit of
extra size to the object files.

This was fine until it triggered a spurious link error in component
builds when symbol_level=2 was selected. This wasn't caught by the bots
because most (all?) of them build with symbol_level=1, or non-component.

This turns off CFG for debug and component builds, thus getting those
builds working again for developers.

If c.example has HSTS with includeSubDomains and b.c.example has HSTS
*without* includeSubDomains, we currently treat a.b.c.example as *not*
HSTS. The b.c.example masks off the c.example entry.

This behavior was, at one point, relied on by a corporate deployment per

matches the spec was incorrect. RFC 6797 sections 8.2 and 8.3 spell out
the matching rules explicitly and they do not include the shadowing
behavior.

The analysis that it matches all other browsers was also incorrect.
Chrome and Firefox have the shadowing behavior while Edge and Safari do
not.

This behavior is also surprising and increases the risk of a
misconfigured site losing HSTS's security properties, particularly
around cookie injection. As the first step towards fixing this, measure
how often this makes a difference,

","Downgrade security level on sites using legacy TLS versions

This adds a check to SecurityStateTabHelper to mark whether a page was
loaded over legacy TLS versions in the VisibleSecurityState struct. This
status is then used by the security_state code to downgrade the security
level to WARNING. The SecurityStateTabHelper code also checks the pref
set by the SSLVersionMin enterprise policy to determine whether to set
the flag in the VisibleSecurityState.

This version can be racy at browser startup, due to how the component
proto is loaded from disk (as BEST_EFFORT). A followup CL will change
that task to USER_VISIBLE to avoid this.

Another followup CL will change the Page Info security summary for pages
with the legacy TLS flag set in their VisibleSecurityState.

","Re-land: Fix `Referer` for descendant module scripts and worklets

This CL addresses a problem with SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer
when it comes to checking the same-origin-ness of a request. The
WebAppSec Referrer Policy Standard defines a same-origin request [1] as
one where the request's origin and current URL are same-origin with
each other. This comparison is done in ""determine a request's referrer""
algorithm.

The analogous place in our implementation is
SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer. Before this CL, GenerateReferrer would
determine a request's same-origin-ness by comparing the origin of the
request's referrer string and the origin of the request's current URL.
Most of the time this was sufficient, as the request's referrer string
is almost always same-origin with the request's origin (initiator
in Blink). With descendant module scripts and worklets however, the
origin of the request's referrer string and request's origin (initiator)
could be different, which breaks the correctness of our GenerateReferrer
method.

This CL introduces a blink::SecurityOrigin parameter to the
GenerateReferrer method, so that correct same-origin comparisons can be
carried out. In all GenerateReferrer call-sites, an appropriate origin
is passed in.

The original CL [2] was reverted because the semantics of
SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer were not kept in sync with the similar
logic in net::URLRequestJob::ComputeReferrerForPolicy, which caused a
DumpWithoutCrashing bug seen in https://crbug.com/1000614, and request
cancellations. This reland updates the ComputeReferrerForPolicy logic
to match the corresponding Blink logic, and includes documentation
mentioning that changes to one section should be reflected in the other.
This CL also includes web platform tests for the scenario in the
aforementioned bug, which pass with this CL, as well as net unit tests
for RedirectInfo and URLRequestJob.

This reverts commit 95fc19d5f03aa7e42434e14a59a8bb54da689de3.

Reason for revert: (To be extra safe for branch point) This CL changes
the semantics of SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer. Similar logic in the
net layer (URLRequestJob::ComputeReferrerForPolicy) must also be updated
alongside the SecurityPolicy changes. At the time of writing this CL I was
not aware of the URLRequestJob method. Not updating this method alongside
my changes caused issues seen in http://crbug.com/1000614.

The next step is to introduce the URLRequestJob alongside this CL, as well
as a web-platform-test ensuring the issues in the crbug do not crop up.
This CL will be re-landed as soon as this is finished, and after the
branch point.

","Fix `Referer` for descendant module scripts and worklets

This CL addresses a problem with SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer
when it comes to checking the same-origin-ness of a request. The
WebAppSec Referrer Policy Standard defines a same-origin request [1] as
one where the request's origin and current URL are same-origin with
each other. This comparison is done in ""determine a request's referrer""
algorithm.

The analogous place in our implementation is
SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer. Before this CL, GenerateReferrer would
determine a request's same-origin-ness by comparing the origin of the
request's referrer string and the origin of the request's current URL.
Most of the time this was sufficient, as the request's referrer string
is almost always same-origin with the request's origin (initiator
in Blink). With descendant module scripts and worklets however, the
origin of the request's referrer string and request's origin (initiator)
could be different, which breaks the correctness of our GenerateReferrer
method.

This CL introduces a blink::SecurityOrigin parameter to the
GenerateReferrer method, so that correct same-origin comparisons can be
carried out. In all GenerateReferrer call-sites, an appropriate origin
is passed in.

","Reland: [shapedetection] Add some shapedetection tests

The original CL has been reverted because the test
external/wpt/shape-detection/detection-HTMLVideoElement-invalid-state.html
is flaky.

In the previous CL, the way to create a HTMLVideoElement with 'HAVE_METADATA'
state is wrong, because simply loading a video file its readyState should
be >= HAVE_METADATA during loadedmetadata event. Which is the reason of the flaky.

This reland CL leverages MediaSource API to precisely trigger a transition
to HAVE_METADATA state by invoking `appendBuffer()` with an initialization segment.

This CL is a quick-fix for the issue detailed in the attached bug.
Devtools' Security tab does not handle properly resources from secure,
non-https, origins, this leads to an attempt to display a certificate
that does not exist and a crash (CHECK). The issue stems in Blink, where
the resources' responses (|ResourceLoader|) are not equal to documents'
responses (|DocumentLoader). This response is then handled differently
by the security tab. The solution proposed here addresses the problem on
Devtools UI side by checking the content of the Response's
SecurityDetails.

near the branch point, the safest thing is to revert this change, and
re-land it with a fix once it is discovered.

","Set ResourceRequest's referrer string and policy separately

This should be the final CL for 863769. Before this CL, there
are situations where we eagerly set a ResourceRequest's `Referer`
with ResourceRequest::SetHttpReferrer, sometimes invoking
SecurityPolicy::GenerateReferrer(...). These calls are equivalent
to the Fetch Standard calling into ""determine request's referrer""
algorithm.

After this CL, we opt to set a ResourceRequest's referrer policy and
string members separately as much as possible, minimizing the number
of calls into ResourceRequest::SetHttpReferrer(SecurityPolicy...). The
Referer header will finally be generated when ResourceFetcher calls
into SetReferrer (equivalent to ""determine request's referrer""
algorithm).

This CL also adds more CSS security tests regarding the `Referer` header.
The only observable effect from this CL is that some shared worker referrer
policy tests start passing because we invoke SetReferrer at the right time.

maintain this security guarantee, the GuardedPageAllocator needs to
taught to know when it is used to back PartitionAlloc, and passed in the

","webauthn: remove the CREDENTIAL_NOT_RECOGNIZED status

The WebAuthn spec says that during a WebAuthn get() request, if an
authenticator returns an error in response to the request, the browser
should simply ignore that device and let the user try a different one
until the user cancels or the request times out, at which point the
browser returns a ""NotAllowedError"" DOMException.

Chrome diverges from the WebAuthn spec a little in that errors from the
authenticator can cause termination of the entire request (depending on
the exact nature of the authenticator's response). Originally, this
resulted in the WebAuthn request's promise to be rejected with an error
immediately.

To allow the relying party (RP) to distinguish a request that was
terminated due to a security key not recognizing any of the presented
credential IDs from other errors (such as the user clicking ""Cancel"" in
the UI), Chrome therefore returned an InvalidStateError for this
particular case, such that the RP could then inform the user that the
security key that they tapped wasn't registered with the site.

Later, Chrome's WebAuthn implementation added an error to its own UI for
this case that informs the user that their security key wasn't
recognized. But Chrome still returns the InvalidState error with a
special message. This change aligns Chrome's behavior with the spec and
makes it return NotAllowedError in this case.

","[Extensions] Update GetEffectiveDocumentURL() to use precursor tuples

Opaque origins (such as about:blank and data: URLs) inherit the security
and privileges of their creator origins, which are tracked in precursor
tuples. ScriptContext::GetEffectiveDocumentURL() attempts to determine
the precursor origin of an opaque URL today by traversing the creation
chain and looking for the first non-about:blank opener or parent.
However, this is not always strictly correct for all opaque origins;
for instance, the precursor tuple of a data: frame may not be that of
its immediate parent in the case of nested iframes.

Update ScriptContext::GetEffectiveDocumentURL() to use
Origin::GetTupleOrPrecursorTupleIfOpaque(), which correctly tracks this.
Note that we still have to do the opener/parent traversal case because
content script matching needs to have the full URL (including path), and
not just the scheme, host, and port tuple.

To balance these, we simply return the document URL (which is
potentially opaque) in the case of a mismatch between opener/parent
traversal and the precursor tuple. This should be an exceptionally
rare case in practice.

Updating this method to use the precursor tuple is a prerequisite for
adding support for data:-URL content script injection.

This reverts commit bade8660ed83112af91387f349565b4ea1922700.

Reason for revert: This CL removed SECURITY_OWNERS from the OWNERS file. Presubmit checks require that to be there, even though it isn't actually necessary for web_feature.mojom where enumeration changes can be added without security review.

This is a reland of https://crrev.com/c/1441277 that
- Trims the test down in a speculative attempt to avoid test flakiness
  (I verified that the test still fails without the corresponding
  changes in TranslateHelper::Translate)
- Adds logging statements to the test, to help in case trimming of the
  test doesn't address the flakiness.
The original CL description follows below.

Google Translate executes its scripts inside ""isolated worlds"".  This is
quite similar to how extension content scripts execute and has a
consequence of using |request_initiator| set to the origin of the
isolated world (rather than to the origin of the page where the script
was injected).  This is problematic for 2 reasons:
1. It leads to renderer kills, when an AppCache verifies
   |request_initiator| using CPSPI::CanAccessDataForOrigin.
2. It leads to incompatibility between |request_initiator| and
   |request_initiator_site_lock| which can also cause wrong/harsh
   security decisions (e.g. CORB blocking of otherwise benign requests).

This CL addresses the problems above, by making sure that requests
initiated by the Translate's ""isolated worls"" will use a separate
URLLoaderFactory.
- For injecting and selecting the factory on the renderer side, the same
  mechanism is used as for extension content scripts (i.e.
  URLLoaderFactoryBundleInfo::initiator_specific_factory_infos is
  populated for the origin associated with the ""isolated world"").
- For simplicity and to avoid races, the separate URLLoaderFactory is
  sent from the browser to the renderer process in the same, single IPC
  that triggers script injection into an isolated world (i.e. in
  translate::mojom::Page::Translate method).

As a side effect, this CL also causes Translate's requests to go
directly to the NetworkService (rather than to the AppCache's
AppCacheSubresourceURLFactory).  This seems desirable.

Google Translate executes its scripts inside ""isolated worlds"".  This is

As a side effect, this CL also causes Translate's requests to go
directly to the NetworkService (rather than to the AppCache's
AppCacheSubresourceURLFactory).  This seems desirable.

This reverts commit 912f47b4715551b4db57f8ed8bed05a83144c2f7 and tries
another approach for protecting network::ResourceRequest::request_initiator
against compromised renderers.  In the new approach:
1. AppCacheHost stores the renderer process id it is associated with.
2. AppCacheSubresourceURLFactory uses the process id to verify
   request_initiator via
   ChildProcessSecurityPolicyImpl::CanAccessDataFromOrigin.
3. The process id needs to be provided to AppCacheHost in 3 scenarios
   (not counting unit tests):
   3.1. SharedWorkerServiceImpl::CreateWorker already has a process id
   3.2. AppCacheBackendImpl::RegisterHost also already has a process id
   3.3. NavigationHandleImpl::InitAppCacheHandle runs when navigation
        starts and doesn't have a process yet.  In this scenario
        ChildProcessHost::kInvalidUniqueID is passed to AppCacheHost's
        constructor and the real process id is provided later, once
        NavigationHandleImpl::ReadyToCommitNavigation knows the target
        process for the navigation.
        - This delay is okay, because AppCacheHost::process_id() is only
          consulted from AppCache*Subresource*URLFactory which is only
          used for subresources and not for navigations.
        - The delay involves a thread hop - this is also okay, because
          the task that will set the process id is posted to the IO
          thread *before* a Commit IPC is sent down to the renderer (and
          therefore subresource requests from the renderer will come
          *after* that task).

> FlagExpectations/site-per-process into the main TestExpectations file.
> The CL preserves non-OOPIF test coverage provided by the disabled tests

Summary
=======

This CL makes layout tests use the default site isolation from the
platform they are run on (instead of opting out of strict site isolation
via LayoutTestContentBrowserClient::ShouldEnableStrictSiteIsolation).
Additionally, on platforms where strict site isolation is enabled,
layout tests opt into slightly stricter isolation by enabling isolation
of same-site origins used by Web Platform Tests - this ensures that
features covered by WPT also get sufficient coverage of out-of-process
iframes (OOPIFs).

After this CL, expectations for tests that differ in behavior with and
without OOPIFs are being moved from
LayoutTests/FlagExpectations/site-per-process to:
- LayoutTests/VirtualTestSuites (virtual/not-site-per-process suite)
- LayoutTests/virtual/not-site-per-process/README.md
- LayoutTests/TestExpectations and LayoutTests/NeverFixTests
  (""Site Isolation failures"" section)


Desirability
============

The CL helps with the following:

- Focusing on testing the mode that is actually shipped to end users
- Helping ensure that newly developed features get site-per-process
  coverage without having to set up a separate step (i.e. it is
  sufficient to set-up a bot that runs layout tests with
  --enable-features=NewFeature without also having to have a separate
  test step for runing layout tests with *both*
  --enable-features=NewFeature *and* --site-per-process

This CL does *not* help with reducing requirements for CQ capacity,
because we need to maintain a separate
not_site_per_process_webkit_layout_tests step to make sure that tests
pass without isolation (which is the mode Chrome ships on Android).
Also note that layout test coverage on Android is very sparse - see
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/blink-dev/SOXhTYysYkE/discussion


Preserving test coverage
========================

Most tests
----------

The CL preserves covering most layout tests with and without OOPIFs, by
relying on the fact that CQ/waterfall run layout tests on both kinds of
platforms - ones that default to strict site isolation (desktop
platforms) and ones that default to no site isolation (Android).


Tests that used to be excluded FlagExpectations/site-per-process
----------------------------------------------------------------

Around 40 tests fail when run in presence of OOPIFs.  Such tests are
disabled by this CL by moving test expectations from
FlagExpectations/site-per-process into the main TestExpectations file.
The CL preserves non-OOPIF test coverage provided by the disabled tests
by introducing virtual/not-site-per-process directory which runs all
such tests with site isolation disabled.  Using a virtual test suites
for preserving the test coverage relies on the ability to have separate
test expectations for these tests (i.e. relying on the fact that
disabling these tests in TestExpectations doesn't disable their
virtual/not-site-per-process equivalents).

Note that the CL keeps isolating ""oopif.test"" site even in
virtual/not-site-per-process suite.  This site should only be used by
tests that require an OOPIF.


Preserving site-per-process-specific test expectations
------------------------------------------------------

Some tests have site-per-process-specific expectations:
- http/tests/inspector-protocol/network/security-info-on-response.js
- http/tests/inspector-protocol/network/raw-headers-for-protected-document.js

The tests above highlight that cross-origin cookies are not displayed in
site-per-process mode (a known regression tracked by
https://crbug.com/849483).  This CL preserves expectations and coverage
by shuffling things around:
- old, main expectation -> android expectation
- old, site-per-process expectation -> main expectation


There is one additional test with site-per-process-specific
expectations:
- external/wpt/dom/events/EventListener-addEventListener.sub.window.js

Unlike the other 2 tests, it seems less important to preserve exact test
expectations for the case when the test fails with Site Isolation.
Therefore this test is covered by virtual/not-site-per-process test
suite and an expectation for this test is added to the main
TestExpectations.


Lost test coverage
------------------

Even with extra caution described above, some test coverage may be lost:

- Features covered by tests only on one kind of platform (e.g. disabled
  on Android) are at risk of losing OOPIF or non-OOPIF coverage.

- Before this CL, site-per-process was also applied to all other
  `virtual/...` test suites.  After this CL,
  `virtual/not-site-per-process` will not provide such coverage.


Cleaned up test expectations
----------------------------

Some additional test expectations clean-up is done, while preserving
test coverage:

- The http/tests/perf/large-inlined-script.html test has been already
  present in `SlowTests` and therefore I didn't include this test in the
  new `virtual/not-site-per-process` suite.

- The http/tests/devtools/network/network-datareceived.js test was
  already marked as expecting a `[Failure]` in TestExpectations and
  therefore I didn't include this test in the new
  `virtual/not-site-per-process` suite.

- The http/tests/devtools/console-cross-origin-iframe-logging.js test
  was already marked as `[Timeout]` in the old TestExpectations but for
  Win only.  Since I can repro a timeout on Linux (with and without site
  isolation), I just extended the old expectation to all platforms and I
  didn't include this test in the new `virtual/not-site-per-process`
  suite.  I also removed the test from SlowTests (since timeouts in the
  test are not expected everywhere).

This change is required due to new security restrictions in Mojave.  We can no longer
inject input w/o being added as an accessibility app in the security applet.

While this sounds like a usefulk speedbump, it causes remote access applications quite
a bit of trouble:
1.) We don't use the restricted API until a user connects so they cannot approve remotely
2.) The dialog appears to only show up once (regardless of approve/deny status)
3.) Users connecting to a locked machine will never see the dialog

This is affecting quite a few CRD users, basically everyone who upgrades to Mojave
will experience this one way or another.  This is the simplest fix (and easiest to merge)
that I could think of to unblock users.  The prompt will only be shown on 10.14+ platforms
and the request is only shown if the app has not been approved.  I'd like to look at the
user feedback after releasing this change to see if more work is needed.

One problem I anticipate is that the dialog shown doesn't have a lot of context and it
refers to the wrapper script (org.chromium.chromoting.me2me.sh) instead of Chrome Remote
Desktop.  If this is confusing, we can wrap the prompt request in a dialog where we control
the text.  My concern with checking in the feature first is that the new strings won't be
available for merging.

Another behavior to call about this impl is that the prompt will be displayed in two instances:
1.) When the host is first started (choosing enable via app/website)
2.) When the user signs in and the host service is started

Scenario #2 will have less context but that is the only way to ask for permission for
users who upgraded and had CRD installed previously.  The dialog is not displayed at the login
screen (i.e. when no one is signed in).

One last note, there is no way that I can see to specify this permission in the manifest or
set up via a script / at install time.  It requires a user action to complete.

This reverts commit 28e953d7d5bd94c1ab319b185eba612f7456df90.

Reason for revert: 
This CL introduces 2 bugs:
1. The new |featuresToBeEnabledOnceAuthenticated_| queue has features pushed to it regardless of whether the user wants to enable or disable the feature. This means the features intended to be disabled are actually enabled when the dialog is closed.
2. The required corresponding backend change required in multidevice_setup_impl.cc is not implemented, meaning the frontend does not prompt the user for a password in situations where the backend expects it. This creates a jarring breakage for the user.

The issue that this is attempting to address should be fixed in M70; instead of merging this broken CL into 70 and then merging a followup, it will be cleaner to revert this CL and then merge a single correct CL into 70.

This reverts commit bde179ef37774467df673068e992dcaca70dabd0.

Reason for revert: http://crrev.com/880583 : The ASan LSan problems disappeared even before the revert was included, and once revert was included there were no extra fix. Therefore relanding the CL.

Overview
========

Flash has its own CORS-like mechanism (crossdomain.xml-based) and
therefore CORB (Cross-Origin Read Blocking) cannot be enforced for
requests initiated by Flash.

This CL avoids making an exception for plugins, unless the given
renderer process is actually hosting a Flash plugin (and is therefore
capable of proxying network requests on behalf of Flash).  This
means that the exception won't take place unless the user has
approved running Flash (via click-to-play / content settings /
enterprise policy - see the bug for more details).


Details
=======

This CL introduces a global set that stores process IDs of renderers
that host Flash.  This set lives either in the NetworkService process or
(if NetworkService feature is disabled) in the IO thread of the browser
process.  In both cases the global set is implemented and exposed by new
static methods of network::CrossOriginReadBlocking class.

The CL populates the global set from
PluginServiceImpl::FindOrStartPpapiPluginProcess after all the security
checks have been done and the plugin process is ready to be used or
launched.

The CL consults the global set before deciding to make a CORB exception
for a plugin request.  This is done from network::URLLoader (used if
NetworkService feature is enabled) and from
CrossSiteDocumentResourceHandler (used otherwise).

The CL removes items from the global set when RenderProcessHostImpl is
destroyed.

Currently, empty CSSStyleSheets can be constructed either with a constructor or with Document.createEmptyCSSStyleSheet.
This CL deletes the constructor so that they can only be produced by Document.createEmptyCSSStyleSheet.

Document.createEmptyCSSStyleSheet is considered to be more desirable, as CSSStyleSheets produced by Document.createEmptyCSSStyleSheet can be tied to documents in the future. This means that their use can be limited in the documents where they were produced, resulting in higher security.

Cr-Commit-Position: 972c6d2dc6dd5efdad1377c0d224e03eb8f276f7@{#580467}","Fixes ExtensionWebRequestApiTest.WebRequestBlocking with network service

Getting this test working required a few fixes:
- Modifying a header rather than Set-Cookie for some tests, which
  required switching to XMLHttpRequest (crbug.com/827582)
- Handling redirect from http:// -> chrome-extension://, and bypassing
  security checks if this is from web request
- Plumbing through whether the request is async or not

This is not handling subresource redirects because subresource
redirects to schemes other than http/https/data are not supported
yet with network service (crbug.com/868545).

Also adds a bunch of tests for redirects.

Cr-Commit-Position: 972c6d2dc6dd5efdad1377c0d224e03eb8f276f7@{#557568}","Do partial redirect handling in the renderer process for sync requests

Historically, blink has not received any intermediate resource loading
callbacks for sync requests. It simply blocked until the load finished
or failed, which meant that redirect security checks performed by blink
would be skipped (and in some cases we would try to reconstruct or do
a partial security check after the fact). SyncLoadContext allows us to
do more of these security checks before the redirect is sent. This
allows us to come closer to doing the correct thing for sync request
in general, and allows us to move some worker requests off-main-thread,
where before they had to proxy sync requests through the main thread in
order to get both proper redirect handling and the correct synchronous
behavior.

This CL ""cancels"" sync requests on redirect. WebURLLoaderImpl then
notifies blink of the redirect, which sends FetchContext callbacks (but
not ResourceClient callbacks). This allows us to do things CSP checking
on redirect. If blink permits the redirect, WebURLLoaderImpl manually
follows the redirect by issuing a new sync request.

ResourceClient callbacks aren't performed becuase sync requests have
historically not been associated with a ResourceClient. Doing so would
be a much large refactor, and would require careful handling to make sure
we didn't enter JS inside what is supposed to be a synchronous blocking
function.

We therefore need to continue to perform a rudimentary CORS check in
SyncLoadContext, which blocks cross-origin redirects if the
FetchRequestMode was anything other than kNoCors. This revealed a couple
of XML/XSLT callsites that should have been setting a FetchRequestMode but
weren't.

crrev.com/c/956654 introduced the bad flags warning of ""stability and
security will suffer"" for Android.
This change caused parformance regressions because a bad flag
""--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list"" is used for perfomance testing.
(crbug.com/822258#c13)

So this cl introduces the check of ""--enable-automation"" flag in ShowBadFlagsPrompt().
This check already exists in startup_browser_creator_impl.cc for Desktop not
to show the infobar during performance tests.

crrev.com/c/catapult/+/965712 will add the flag in the script of catapult.

Constructing origins manually and storing them in Urls is error-prone

the origin could be formed (eg GURLUtils has a trailing '/' while

In this CL:
* //services/audio infrastructure
* AudioDeviceDescription type mapping - may need to be moved to //media? (Someday we want it all
to be in //audio though.)
* Build files/dependencies - please review vigorously, I'm not sure everything is fine there.

* AudioSystemToMojoAdapter: client-side media::AudioSystem implementation on top of
mojom::SystemInfo
* Unit tests.
* A fix for Connector::BindInterface() when there are binder overrides available (see discussion
in PS17)

Upcoming CLs for AudioService infrastructure:
- Run in-process Audio service and
instantiate BrowserMainLoop::audio_system_ with AudioSystemToMojoAdapter, so
that audio system information is served through the service.
- UMA stats for service usage.
- Tear down the service when not in use (service side, client side)
- Out-of-process AudioService implementation + unit tests

When a table part box is removed from the layout tree, we may end up
with two anonymous layout part siblings which needs to be merged. We
move the children of the latter into the former. When children of the
latter are themselves anonymous, skip down the layout tree until we find
non-anonymous boxes. This will make sure we merge multiple levels of
anonymous boxes although it means we will have to recreate the anonymous
ancestors of the moved box when the preceding box we are moving it to

The CL tweaks StoragePartitonInterceptor (in
isolated_origin_browsertest.cc) so that it can be configured to inject
different origins, depending on needs of individual tests.  This tweak
is supported by changes in base/lazy_instance.h (adding of inequality
operator implemented on top of the already existing equality operator),
and in render_process_host_impl.cc/.h (to support creating a test-only

Tweaks of StoragePartitonInterceptor allow forking of
IsolatedOriginTest.LocalStorageOriginEnforcement test into 2 separate
tests:
- LocalStorageOriginEnforcement_IsolatedAccessingNonIsolated
- LocalStorageOriginEnforcement_NonIsolatedAccessingIsolated
The second test is introduced by this CL and was failing before this CL.

Tweaks of ChildProcessSecurityPolicyImpl::CanAccessDataForOrigin
disallow requests from non-isolated renderers (in which case
CheckOriginLock will return NO_LOCK) if the request is for
an isolated origin.  This makes the new test pass.

This reverts commit 9d5cafcaf5380fcaec80a4d0105df025b495d06f.

Original CL description:

When library CDM is enabled, when connecting to the MediaService, use a
CDM-type-specific CDM GUID as the service_manager Identity user ID, so
that the CDM service of each CDM type will run in its own MediaService
instance, in its own process!

This helps isolate different CDMs in it's own process for better
security and stability. This also makes the implementation simpler by
allowing CdmModule to be a per-process singleton that is initialized for
only one single CDM type.

To test the multiple_cdm_types.html in the browser (instead of in the
browser_test itself), you would need to:

1. Disable unique origin check in WebContentDecryptionModuleImpl::Create

2. Run the following command:

   out/GN/chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/foo
     --enable-features=MojoCdm,ExternalClearKeyForTesting,SupportExperimentalCdmInterface
     --register-pepper-plugins=""<path_to_chromium_repo>/src/out/GN/libclearkeycdmadapter.so;application/x-ppapi-clearkey-cdm""
     --clear-key-cdm-path-for-testing=<path_to_chromium_repo>/src/out/GN/libclearkeycdm.so
     file:///<path_to_chromium_repo>/src/media/test/data/multiple_cdm_types.html

In the future, we should be able drop  SupportExperimentalCdmInterface
and MojoCdm in --enable-features, as well as --register-pepper-plugins.

This reverts commit 7d0f75c321cae8a33f60fd291157d4c5d3fa9d01.

Reason: This change introduced a potential security risk,
wherein inserting particular strings of characters into a
text field could cause a DCHECK failure in
TextRunConstructor.cpp.

It should be relanded once it can be verified that it
doesn't cause a problem like https://crbug.com/751193.

This reverts commit 2212fff4c5c99b212506380f3a7310456ba7d2bd.

Reason for revert:
The mentioned test exception is seen before the original change:
https://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.gpu/builders/Linux%20Release%20%28NVIDIA%29/builds/108556
and after the revert:
https://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.gpu/builders/Mac%20Retina%20Release%20%28AMD%29/builds/12225
The original change hence should not be related.
It doesn't even touch any code compiled for windows or mac.

This reverts commit 00043bdefebe1d854b0cffbd1d35d90c0091057c.

Reason for revert: Removing the swapped out IPC filtering resulted in some layout tests to fail with Site Isolation. The ShellViewHostMsg_TextDump and ShellViewHostMsg_TestFinished IPCs are no longer filtered, which results in different test expectations.
The failing tests are:
http/tests/security/mixedContent/insecure-prefetch-in-main-frame.html
http/tests/security/mixedContent/blob-url-in-iframe.html
http/tests/inspector/change-iframe-src.html

This reverts commit 8068f1a91f043c26ecdc15ad78fe6878a8fc8957.

This reverted commit introduces a regression where Cilium Endpoints can
be left around after the Cilium Endpoint was locally deleted. Although
it was a scale optimization for non existing docker images, the security
aspect will overlap the scalability concern initially thought.

","endpointsynchronizer: do not delete CEP when endpoint is deleted

Deleting a CEP upon the deletion of an endpoint can be harmful in certain
conditions. When a pod specifies a container image that does not exist
kubelet might send a CNI ADD, a CNI DEL followed by another
CNI ADD, this causes Cilium to create a CEP, delete it and then
re-create it. Since the CEP has an owner for itself (the created Pod)
and the Cilium Operator is doing the GC of dangling CEPs, removing the
CEP after an endpoint is removed should no longer be required as well as
decreases the k8s interactions Cilium does to Kubernetes.

* HUE-3102 [libsaml] Add support for private key passwords

This is also tracked by IdentityPython/pysaml2#278.

This patch adds support for SAML certificates that are protected
with a password. The way it does so is with a bit of trickiness,
due to the fact that `xmlsec1`, which is an external program that
pysaml2 uses to sign the XML requests, which does not have great
support for password protected certificates. It either supports
passing in the password on the command line (which is not safe
since someone else on the machine could see the password), or
through an interactive prompt.

The proper way to fix this would be to update pysaml2 to use
another xmlsec library, but implementing that may take some
time. In the short/medium term, this patch implements this
instead by decrypting the certificate in memory, and passing
this decrypted certificate to xmlsec1 through a named pipe.
This protects us from the decrypted certificate ever hitting
the disk.

Unfortunately, this solution is only portable to
POSIX-compatible platforms. That is fine for Hue, but it
probably means we cannot push this patch to the upstream
pysaml2 repository. This patch will tied us over until
the upstream project switches to a better xmlsec library.

This reverts commit fdb9805d6884090fd7bf62dbdf9c858692e55fb4.

CB:33252 wasn't reviewed by a TPM maintainer and breaks abstraction
layers (pulling TSS-details into TSPI, completely changing
interpretation of the arguments to tlcl_extend() based on TSS version).
It's also not clear why it was implemented the way it was (should have
been much easier and cleaner ways to achieve the same thing).

Since the author is not reacting, let's revert it for now. It can be
cleaned up and resubmitted later. (Not reverting the header changes
since those are not objectionable, and there are later patches dependent
on it.)

This reverts commit 598af2e2c2785c00eb4290cdcefe1082b2a6f858.

Reason for revert: This commit breaks every board with VBOOT enabled
if the platform is apollolake, broadwell, skylake, baswell, baytrails
or icelake. The reason is, that the SoC selects
VBOOT_MUST_REQUEST_DISPLAY by default, and this has a dependency now
on VBOOT_MAY_SKIP_DISPLAY_INIT. This will only be auto-selected if
it is a CHROMEOS platform.

","src/security/vboot: Add option to skip display init with vboot 2.0

This config option, when set, will allow the platform to skip display
initialization in normal (non-developer, non-recovery) mode. This allows
platforms that do not implement firmware UI in normal mode to skip the
display init in firmware.

TEST=Set option CONFIG_VBOOT and clear CONFIG_VBOOT_MAY_SKIP_DISPLAY_INIT
     and the display should initialize in ramstage when platform boots. Set
     CONFIG_VBOOT and set CONFIG_VBOOT_MAY_SKIP_DISPLAY_INIT and the display
     initialization should be skipped in coreboot.

So we're lucky we're not using the master branch to update our swarm services here because if we someone had pushed to it, it would have triggered a docs.docker.com build. This is becuase this Jenkinsfile, which has been merged from the docker.github.io project has the content for updating docs.docker.com and not beta.docs.docker.com. Maria and I have worked out a potential solution to this problem and I hope to implement it today.

* Fix the DDE Overview ToC

* make Jenkinsfile serve private and public docs

After a couple of Jenkins-based mix-ups it became obvious we needed a Jenkinsfile that would serve both public and private projects, that we could move between repos without worry. This Jenkinsfile knows which images to build and push and which swarm services to update because of the use of git_url and branch conditions.

* update jenkinsfile with very important protections

So we're lucky we're not using the master branch to update our swarm services here because if we someone had pushed to it, it would have triggered a docs.docker.com build. This is becuase this Jenkinsfile, which has been merged from the docker.github.io project has the content for updating docs.docker.com and not beta.docs.docker.com. Maria and I have worked out a potential solution to this problem and I hope to implement it today.

This Jenkinsfile knows which images to build and push and which swarm services to update because of the use of git_url and branch conditions.

* Use site parameter to use latest compose file versions in examples

Make sure that examples use the latest version of the compose file
format, to encourage using the latest version, and to prevent
users from running into ""not supported by this version"" problems
when copy/pasting, and combining examples that use different
versions.

Also add a note about `version: x` not being equivalent to
`version: x.latest`.

Note that there are still some examples using fixed versions
in the UCP sections; we need to evaluate those to make sure
the right (and supported) versions are used for UCP (which may
be different than ""latest"").

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

Added examples with more detail and automation to help customers backup DTR without creating support tickets.

* Linked to explanation of example command

@omegamormegil I removed the example with prepopulated fields, as I think it doesn't add much, and will only add confusion. Users who need this much detail can run the basic command and follow the terminal prompts. 

We can re-add in a follow-up PR, if you think that example is crucial to this page.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

@omegamormegil I removed the example with prepopulated fields, as I think it doesn't add much, and will only add confusion. Users who need this much detail can run the basic command and follow the terminal prompts. 

We can re-add in a follow-up PR, if you think that example is crucial to this page.

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

Added examples with more detail and automation to help customers backup DTR without creating support tickets.

* Linked to explanation of example command

@omegamormegil I removed the example with prepopulated fields, as I think it doesn't add much, and will only add confusion. Users who need this much detail can run the basic command and follow the terminal prompts. 

We can re-add in a follow-up PR, if you think that example is crucial to this page.

After a couple of Jenkins-based mix-ups it became obvious we needed a Jenkinsfile that would serve both public and private projects, that we could move between repos without worry. This Jenkinsfile knows which images to build and push and which swarm services to update because of the use of git_url and branch conditions.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

So we're lucky we're not using the master branch to update our swarm services here because if we someone had pushed to it, it would have triggered a docs.docker.com build. This is becuase this Jenkinsfile, which has been merged from the docker.github.io project has the content for updating docs.docker.com and not beta.docs.docker.com. Maria and I have worked out a potential solution to this problem and I hope to implement it today.

* update jenkinsfile with very important protections

So we're lucky we're not using the master branch to update our swarm services here because if we someone had pushed to it, it would have triggered a docs.docker.com build. This is becuase this Jenkinsfile, which has been merged from the docker.github.io project has the content for updating docs.docker.com and not beta.docs.docker.com. Maria and I have worked out a potential solution to this problem and I hope to implement it today.

* add protection to Jenkinsfile

* make jenkinsfile serve private and public docs

After a couple of Jenkins-based mix-ups it became obvious we needed a Jenkinsfile that would serve both public and private projects, that we could move between repos without worry. This Jenkinsfile knows which images to build and push and which swarm services to update because of the use of git_url and branch conditions.

* Use site parameter to use latest compose file versions in examples

Make sure that examples use the latest version of the compose file
format, to encourage using the latest version, and to prevent
users from running into ""not supported by this version"" problems
when copy/pasting, and combining examples that use different
versions.

Also add a note about `version: x` not being equivalent to
`version: x.latest`.

Note that there are still some examples using fixed versions
in the UCP sections; we need to evaluate those to make sure
the right (and supported) versions are used for UCP (which may
be different than ""latest"").

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

versions.

Also add a note about `version: x` not being equivalent to
`version: x.latest`.

Note that there are still some examples using fixed versions
in the UCP sections; we need to evaluate those to make sure
the right (and supported) versions are used for UCP (which may
be different than ""latest"").

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica.
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag.
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica.
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag.
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica.
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag.
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

So we're lucky we're not using the master branch to update our swarm services here because if we someone had pushed to it, it would have triggered a docs.docker.com build. This is becuase this Jenkinsfile, which has been merged from the docker.github.io project has the content for updating docs.docker.com and not beta.docs.docker.com. Maria and I have worked out a potential solution to this problem and I hope to implement it today.

Make sure that examples use the latest version of the compose file
format, to encourage using the latest version, and to prevent
users from running into ""not supported by this version"" problems
when copy/pasting, and combining examples that use different
versions.

Also add a note about `version: x` not being equivalent to
`version: x.latest`.

Note that there are still some examples using fixed versions
in the UCP sections; we need to evaluate those to make sure
the right (and supported) versions are used for UCP (which may
be different than ""latest"").

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

This Jenkinsfile knows which images to build and push and which swarm services to update because of the use of git_url and branch conditions.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Improved backup commands

DTR image backup command improvements:

1. Local and NFS mount image backup commands were invalid (incorrectly used -C flag). Replaced them with commands that work.
2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

* Linked to explanation of example command

@omegamormegil I removed the example with prepopulated fields, as I think it doesn't add much, and will only add confusion. Users who need this much detail can run the basic command and follow the terminal prompts. 

We can re-add in a follow-up PR, if you think that example is crucial to this page.

After a couple of Jenkins-based mix-ups it became obvious we needed a Jenkinsfile that would serve both public and private projects, that we could move between repos without worry. This Jenkinsfile knows which images to build and push and which swarm services to update because of the use of git_url and branch conditions.

2. The new commands automatically populate the correct replica ID and add a datestamp to the backup filename.

DTR Metadata backup command improvements:

DTR metadata backups are more difficult than they need to be and generate many support tickets. I updated the DTR command to avoid common user pitfalls:

1. The prior metadata backup command was subject to user error. Improved the command to automatically collect the DTR version and select a replica. 
2. Improved security of the command by automatically collecting UCP CA certificate for verification rather than using --ucp-insecure-tls flag. 
3. Improved the backup filename by adding the backed-up version information and date of backup. Knowledge of the version information is required for restoring a backup.
4. Described these improvements for the user.

Image backup commands were tested with local and NFS image storage. The metadata backup command was tested by running it directly on a DTR node and through a UCP client bundle with multiple replicas.

This reverts commit 350954589774499d99bf87cb5631c664bb0707c4.

We cannot force increase in minimum SASL security factor until our
consumers are ready to deal with it. Unfortunately, realmd uses
anonymous connection for discovery and validation of IPA LDAP server.

The way it is done is fragile (it doesn't take into account an
advertised IPA version, only checks that 'IPA' string exists in the info
field) but since bumping of minimum SSF prevents reading IPA info field
using anonymous connection, client enrollment fails.

We should get back to bumping minimum SSF after realmd and other
potential consumers are fixed.

SSF_MINX 56 level ensures data integrity and confidentiality for SASL

for backwards compatibility with systems that announce wrong SSF.

With conversion to getStringView() access there is no longer any need to
reserve a NUL byte at the end of the HeaderString since all accesses
will be through string_views which are not required to be NUL
terminated.

Ran bazel test -c opt //test/... --config=asan --runs_per_test=10
without issue. There is some risk that someone has or will abuse the
data() accessor on a string_view assuming it is NUL terminated. A
comment is added to emphasize that the HeaderString::getStringView() is
not NUL terminated.

By eliminating this wasted byte it is more likely that a HeaderString
will fit into the existing embedded space, hopefully giving a small
performance gain and reduction in memory allocations.

This reverts commit ed1d7eacf47534fc6aae6571b7d41bca3951d0e9 and fixes
the issue in a different way.

With the introduction of peer (LAN/USB) sources of refs comes a problem:
they may have outdated repository metadata (which is stored as
contentless commits on the branch ""ostree-metadata""). Currently Flatpak
allows the older metadata to be pulled into the local repo, but this is
undesirable for a few reasons: it hurts the security properties of the
system because for example the GPG keys might have been rotated and you
don't want to go back to using the old ones, and it's undesirable
because the old metadata might have missing or wrong information about
the apps installed on the system.

So this commit makes Flatpak ignore the downgrade and use the newer
metadata for the offline operation. This is not a perfect solution,
because the newer metadata might have information (such as the download
size or needed runtime) that's not accurate for the old versions of the
refs that are available offline. This issue is significantly mitigated
by the fact that FlatpakTransaction operations use commit metadata to
make decisions, rather than depending on the xa.cache.

Another possible solution would be to read the outdated metadata into
the FlatpakRemoteState object without pulling it into the local repo or
using it to update the remote config, but that's not perfect either
because there's no guarantee you'll pull the metadata from the same
source as the refs (perhaps one comes from a USB drive and the other
from a LAN peer). Longer term, we should figure out how to rely less on
the xa.cache (which is stored in ostree-metadata) or otherwise make
architectural changes to solve those issues. For now, I think this fix
will be enough to make USB updates usable and secure.

","Fix regression from #1961 which broke the tests

Sometimes (for example in some test-repo-collections.sh test that broke) we
update from a remote with an older ostree-metadata branch, and the
check for downgrades broke in this case.

Its unclear exactly what it the best solution here, maybe to silently
disallow the update. However, this change instead just re-allows the
downgrade for this particular case so we get the old behaviour.

        perf(gatsby): Support `lte` for indexed fast filters (#22932)

        * Rename function to better fit what it returns

        * Use `filterCacheKey` more consistently

        * Consistency around `nodesPerValue`

        * Fix the name and typing of array of sets of nodes

        * Fix typing, fix perf bug

        The typing of the array of caches was incorrect (see previous commit too).

        The sort, affected in this commit, was sorting by `.length`, but the value is a `Set` so the intention was to sort by `.size` since its `.length` will always be `undefined`. This won't change semantics, just meant that the sort didn't do anything, leading to a sub-optimal performance.

        * Extend the `FilterCache` type to support op-specific meta data

        * Replace wild usage of `FilterType`

        * Refactor some old comments / naming to be consistent with current code / types

        * Suggested changes

        Followup commits suggested by @vladar in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/22742

        * Enable `lte` for fast filters

        * Mandatory lint/type fix commit

        * And the loki commit

        * Enable/disable query and eleeMatch ops in one place

        * Fix tests, fix lte binary search lookup

        * Support `null` properly and handle not found binary search case

        The binary search should not return an arbitrary node, but rather a signal value (`undefined` in this case) that it failed somehow. It shouldn't, but who knows.

        The `null` case was a bit more work because it affects typign and all kinds of weird comparing edge cases. There's also a distinction between how `eq` treats `null` target values versus how `lte` treats them. So I had to encode them differently in the cache. Hence the type update.

        * Sigh, this is why I had to introduce that type in the first place

        * Forgot to remove an argument from followup work

        * Apply suggestions

        fix(gatsby): Set a timeout of 15 seconds on queries (#23036)

        With a timeout set, eventually the hanging query will fail with an error like this which should help people figure out where to investigate

        Update programmatically-creating-pages.md (#22944)

        There is a slight inconsistency in the docs for the final steps of the `Make a template for your posts` section.

        The docs have separated this section into two steps (creating an MDX layout component + adding a GraphQL query) but when showing the completed component code (`src/components/posts-page-layout.js`)  the component is missing some imports and the `<MDXProvider>` component that were present in the first step of this section.

        docs: use PageQuery in gatsby image example snippet (#22815)

        This updates the example snippets on the /docs/using-gatsby-image
        documentation page to use PageQueries instead of StaticQueries, because
        the example snippets have a src/pages/index.js filename.

        The hope is that since the snippet filenames are in the pages directory,
        it's more consistent with other documentation to use PageQueries when
        in a src/pages/*.js file instead of a StaticQuery, which from the
        documentation appears to be used in places like src/components/*.js.

        chore(starters): add gatsby-starter-basic-bootstrap (#22837)

        Nothing earth-shattering here, simply a starter with  *just* react-bootstrap and sass
        support. Many other existing starters bring a lot of additional bells and whistles.

        The starter was redesigned and extended into a Gatsby Theme.

        * chore(starters): switch gatsby-starter-oss to starter repo

        The theme's repo at robinmetral/gatsby-theme-oss is not a valid starter although the tree contains one, because it cannot be installed with the gatsby-cli using gatsby new.

        To solve this, the starter is now being auto-published on robinmetral/gatsby-starter-oss.

        chore: Upgrade and consolidate @types/react (#22710)

        We used to only inherit it transitively via @types/prop-types, but a lot
        of typings actually need it.

        This will helps us pull the latest @type/reach__router package, which
        (only implicitly, unfortuately) depends on more recent react types than
        the ones we have.

        For example, helps in #22563.

        perf(gatsby): Support `lte` for indexed fast filters (#22932)

        * Rename function to better fit what it returns

        * Use `filterCacheKey` more consistently

        * Consistency around `nodesPerValue`

        * Fix the name and typing of array of sets of nodes

        * Fix typing, fix perf bug

        The typing of the array of caches was incorrect (see previous commit too).

        The sort, affected in this commit, was sorting by `.length`, but the value is a `Set` so the intention was to sort by `.size` since its `.length` will always be `undefined`. This won't change semantics, just meant that the sort didn't do anything, leading to a sub-optimal performance.

        * Extend the `FilterCache` type to support op-specific meta data

        * Replace wild usage of `FilterType`

        * Refactor some old comments / naming to be consistent with current code / types

        * Suggested changes

        Followup commits suggested by @vladar in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/22742

        * Enable `lte` for fast filters

        * Mandatory lint/type fix commit

        * And the loki commit

        * Enable/disable query and eleeMatch ops in one place

        * Fix tests, fix lte binary search lookup

        * Support `null` properly and handle not found binary search case

        The binary search should not return an arbitrary node, but rather a signal value (`undefined` in this case) that it failed somehow. It shouldn't, but who knows.

        The `null` case was a bit more work because it affects typign and all kinds of weird comparing edge cases. There's also a distinction between how `eq` treats `null` target values versus how `lte` treats them. So I had to encode them differently in the cache. Hence the type update.

        * Sigh, this is why I had to introduce that type in the first place

        * Forgot to remove an argument from followup work

        * Apply suggestions

        fix(gatsby): Set a timeout of 15 seconds on queries (#23036)

        Query resolvers can hang indefinitely right now which can be confusing to debug as there's no indication of what's happening.

        With a timeout set, eventually the hanging query will fail with an error like this which should help people figure out where to investigate

    docs: use PageQuery in gatsby image example snippet (#22815)

    This updates the example snippets on the /docs/using-gatsby-image
    documentation page to use PageQueries instead of StaticQueries, because
    the example snippets have a src/pages/index.js filename.

    The hope is that since the snippet filenames are in the pages directory,
    it's more consistent with other documentation to use PageQueries when
    in a src/pages/*.js file instead of a StaticQuery, which from the
    documentation appears to be used in places like src/components/*.js.

    chore(starters): add gatsby-starter-basic-bootstrap (#22837)

    Nothing earth-shattering here, simply a starter with  *just* react-bootstrap and sass
    support. Many other existing starters bring a lot of additional bells and whistles.

    chore(starters): update gatsby-theme-oss (#22698)

    * chore(starters): update gatsby-theme-oss

    The starter was redesigned and extended into a Gatsby Theme.
    https://github.com/robinmetral/gatsby-theme-oss

    * chore(starters): switch gatsby-starter-oss to starter repo

    The theme's repo at robinmetral/gatsby-theme-oss is not a valid starter although the tree contains one, because it cannot be installed with the gatsby-cli using gatsby new.

    To solve this, the starter is now being auto-published on robinmetral/gatsby-starter-oss.

    chore: Upgrade and consolidate @types/react (#22710)

    We used to only inherit it transitively via @types/prop-types, but a lot
    of typings actually need it.

    This will helps us pull the latest @type/reach__router package, which
    (only implicitly, unfortuately) depends on more recent react types than
    the ones we have.

    For example, helps in #22563.

    perf(gatsby): Support `lte` for indexed fast filters (#22932)

    * Rename function to better fit what it returns

    * Use `filterCacheKey` more consistently

    * Consistency around `nodesPerValue`

    * Fix the name and typing of array of sets of nodes

    * Fix typing, fix perf bug

    The typing of the array of caches was incorrect (see previous commit too).

    The sort, affected in this commit, was sorting by `.length`, but the value is a `Set` so the intention was to sort by `.size` since its `.length` will always be `undefined`. This won't change semantics, just meant that the sort didn't do anything, leading to a sub-optimal performance.

    * Extend the `FilterCache` type to support op-specific meta data

    * Replace wild usage of `FilterType`

    * Refactor some old comments / naming to be consistent with current code / types

    * Suggested changes

    Followup commits suggested by @vladar in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/22742

    * Enable `lte` for fast filters

    * Mandatory lint/type fix commit

    * And the loki commit

    * Enable/disable query and eleeMatch ops in one place

    * Fix tests, fix lte binary search lookup

    * Support `null` properly and handle not found binary search case

    The binary search should not return an arbitrary node, but rather a signal value (`undefined` in this case) that it failed somehow. It shouldn't, but who knows.

    The `null` case was a bit more work because it affects typign and all kinds of weird comparing edge cases. There's also a distinction between how `eq` treats `null` target values versus how `lte` treats them. So I had to encode them differently in the cache. Hence the type update.

    * Sigh, this is why I had to introduce that type in the first place

    * Forgot to remove an argument from followup work

    * Apply suggestions

    Benchmarks tune circleci (#22872)

    * Without this they (e.g. MDX) fail with ENOMEM

    * circleci: Remove incorrect second npm install

    * A second npm install would invalidate the second WARM_START build
      numbers

    Update programmatically-creating-pages.md (#22944)

    There is a slight inconsistency in the docs for the final steps of the `Make a template for your posts` section.

    The docs have separated this section into two steps (creating an MDX layout component + adding a GraphQL query) but when showing the completed component code (`src/components/posts-page-layout.js`)  the component is missing some imports and the `<MDXProvider>` component that were present in the first step of this section.

This reverts commit 97106f9d80f6ba1bf5eafbd5a6f88d72913ec5a1.

This is based on feedback from https://reviews.llvm.org/D82988#2147105
","[RISCV] Avoid Splitting MBB in RISCVExpandPseudo

Since the `RISCVExpandPseudo` pass has been split from
`RISCVExpandAtomicPseudo` pass, it would be nice to run the former as
early as possible (The latter has to be run as late as possible to
ensure correctness). Running earlier means we can reschedule these pairs
as we see fit.

Running earlier in the machine pass pipeline is good, but would mean
teaching many more passes about `hasLabelMustBeEmitted`. Splitting the
basic blocks also pessimises possible optimisations because some
optimisations are MBB-local, and others are disabled if the block has
its address taken (which is notionally what `hasLabelMustBeEmitted`
means).

This patch uses a new approach of setting the pre-instruction symbol on
the AUIPC instruction to a temporary symbol and referencing that. This
avoids splitting the basic block, but allows us to reference exactly the
instruction that we need to. Notionally, this approach seems more
correct because we do actually want to address a specific instruction.

This then allows the pass to be moved much earlier in the pass pipeline,
before both scheduling and register allocation. However, to do so we
must leave the MIR in SSA form (by not redefining registers), and so use
a virtual register for the intermediate value. By using this virtual
register, this pass now has to come before register allocation.

We need the protocol negotiator exposed for alternative
handshake/security mechanisms.
","netty: hide ProtocolNegotiator, and expose initial ChannelHandler

* netty: hide ProtocolNegotiator, and expose initial ChannelHandler

This change does two things: it hides the ProtocolNegotiator from
NSB, and exposes an internal ""init channel"" on NSB and NCB.  The
reason for the change is that PN is not a powerful enough
abstraction for internal Google use (and for some other outside
users with highly specific uses).

The new API exposes adding a ChannelHandler to the pipeline upon
registration of the channel.

To accomplish this, NettyClientTransport is modified to use
ChannelInitializer.  There is a comment explaining why it cannot
be used, but after looking at the the original discussion, I
believe the reasons for doing so are no longer applicable.

Specifically, at the time that CI was removed, there was no
WriteQueue class.  The WQ class buffers all writes and executes
them on the EventLoop.  Prior to WQ it was not the case that all
writes happened on the loop, so it could race.  If the write was
not on the loop, it would be put on the loops execution queue,
but with the CI handler as the target.  Since CI removed itself
upon registration, the write wouldn get fired on the wrong
handler.

With the additional of WQ, this is no longer a problem.  All
writes go through WQ, and only execute on the loop, so pipeline
changes are no longer racy.

...That is, except for the initial noop write.  This does still
experience the race.  If the channel is failed during
registration or connect, the lifecycle manager will fail for
differing, racy reasons.

====

To make things more uniform across NCT and NST, I have put them
both back to using CI.  I have added listeners to each of the
bootstrap futures.  I have also moved the initial write to the
CI, so that it always goes through the the buffering negotiation
handler.

Lastly, racy shutdown errors will be logged so that if multiple
callbacks try to shutdown, it will be obvious where they came
from and in which order they happened.

I am not sure how to test the raciness of this code, but I *think*
it is deterministic.  From my reading, Promises are resolved
before channel events so the first future to complete should be the
winner.  Since listeners are always added from the same thread,
and resolved by the loop, I think this forces determinism.

One last note: the negotiator has a scheme that is hard coded
after the transport has started.  This makes it impossible to
change schemes after the channel is started.  Thats okay, but it
should be a use case we knowingly prevent.  Others may want to
do something more bold than we do.

","Add automatic security session for a family of daemons. #6788

This security session works like the existing parent-child security
session, but is a single session shared by an entire process tree of
daemons. Each daemon passes the session to its children (if creating a
command port for them and their priv state isn't a final one). If a
daemon doesn't inherit a session from its parent, it creates a new one.

When connecting to a daemon on a local interface, the client daemon will
attempt to use the family session. It includes the sinful string of the
server in the DC_AUTHENTICATE ad under the new attribute ConnectSinful.
If the server doesn't recognize the family session id, it will include
the ConnectSinful address in its DC_INVALIDATE_KEY response. The client
daemon will add the sinful to its ""not my family"" set, and will not use
the family session for any future connections to that server.

The family session provides the following authorization levels:
DAEMON
ADVERTISE_MASTER
ADVERTISE_SCHEDD
ADVERTISE_STARTD
NEGOTIATOR
WRITE (implied by DAEMON)
READ (implied by DAEMON)

This should allow a personal Condor to work without any additional
security configuration.

Use of the family security session can be disabled by setting
SEC_USE_FAMILY_SESSION to False in the config file.

This reverts commit e0f4e74a9d2e93d07f0f2ab213a45d2fbe066c96.
That patch short-circuited some of the necessary steps to resume
a security session.
","Bug fix: Client now knows when it is resuming an authenticated session.
The bug was if the client connects to a server, and a session is reused,
subsequent calls to sock::isAuthenticated would report false because
nothing ever called setFullyQualifiedUser on the client in the event
of a session reuse.  Further, there was a second bug: if a session was
reused, we needed to return StartCommandSucceeded so that the outer loop
on the client that has all the session stack unroll logic does not continue
marching forward on authenticating.  Whew.  Got all that buddy?
Note: Neither Zach nor myself are super comfortable with this part of
the code yet.  Warrants further review.

The change was introduced in v2.15.0. Since the filename can be anything, it
was found in some small cases the mime-type determined based on filename can
be incorrect. This also created a potential security issue for an application.

Therefore the change is reverted and Shrine will have a method for users to
allow Marcel to fallback to using the filename if they choose to.

","qemuSecurityDomainRestorePathLabel: Introduce @ignoreNS argument

In a few cases we might set seclabels on a path outside of
namespaces. For instance, when restoring a domain from a file,
the file is opened, relabelled and only then the namespace is
created and the FD is passed to QEMU (see v6.3.0-rc1~108 for more
info). Therefore, when restoring the label on the restore file,
we must ignore domain namespaces and restore the label directly
in the host.

This bug demonstrates itself when restoring a domain from a block
device. We don't create the block device inside the domain
namespace and thus the following error is reported at the end of
(otherwise successful) restore:

error : virProcessRunInFork:1236 : internal error: child reported (status=125): unable to stat: /dev/sda: No such file or directory

","security_manager: Load lock plugin on init

Now that we know what metadata lock manager user wishes to use we
can load it when initializing security driver. This is achieved
by adding new argument to virSecurityManagerNewDriver() and
subsequently to all functions that end up calling it.

The cfg.mk change is needed in order to allow lock_manager.h
inclusion in security driver without 'syntax-check' complaining.
This is safe thing to do as locking APIs will always exist (it's
only backend implementation that changes). However, instead of
allowing the include for all other drivers (like cpu, network,
and so on) allow it only for security driver. This will still
trigger the error if including from other drivers.

In order for memory locking to work, the hard limit on memory
locking (and usage) has to be set appropriately by the user.

by forbidding a non-compliant guest from being defined as well

* Make docker files easier to use during development.

During development it quite nice to have docker work with locally built code. This allows you to launch all services very quickly, with your changes, and optionally with debugging support.

Changes made to docker files:
- Removed all redundant docker-compose files. We now have 1 giant file, and smaller files to use as overrides.
- Remove redundant README files that provided little information.
- Rename docker/<dir> to match the service name in the docker-compose file for clarity.
- Move environment variables to .env files. We only provide dev / the default environment for quickstart.
- Add debug options to docker files using multistage build to build minimal images with the idea that built files will be mounted instead.
- Add a docker/dev.sh script + compose file to easily use the dev override images (separate tag; images never published; uses debug docker files; mounts binaries to image).
- Added docs/docker documentation for this.

* build: fix docker actions. (#1787)

* bug: Fix docker actions.

We renamed directories in docker/ which broke the actions.

Also try to refactor the action files a little so that we can run (but not publish) these images on pull requests that change the docker/ dir as an extra check. Note this only seems to be supported by the dockerhub plugin; the github plugin doesn't support this (so that will be an issue when we move to it only).

fix: Update defaults of aspectNames params.

The last PR to sync internal code broke the external GMS, as code was now expected aspectNames to be null rather than empty by default. This preventing me logging into DataHub as the corp user request would fail (it assumed I asked for no aspects rather than all aspects).

TESTED: Built locally, launched with docker/dev.sh (so used latest frontend, but whatever). Verified I can now log into DataHub, browse and search for datasets, and view my profile.

With conversion to getStringView() access there is no longer any need to
reserve a NUL byte at the end of the HeaderString since all accesses
will be through string_views which are not required to be NUL
terminated.

Ran bazel test -c opt //test/... --config=asan --runs_per_test=10
without issue. There is some risk that someone has or will abuse the
data() accessor on a string_view assuming it is NUL terminated. A
comment is added to emphasize that the HeaderString::getStringView() is
not NUL terminated.

By eliminating this wasted byte it is more likely that a HeaderString
will fit into the existing embedded space, hopefully giving a small
performance gain and reduction in memory allocations.

This reverts commit 8ee1c9a07a3a35e3ed262fbc358fd86c257a966e.

No rationale was given for this change prior to merging. After the fact
it was described as desired by distro packagers, however as a distro
packager I believe this commit hurts me.

From a distro packaging perspective, we primarily care about one thing:
previously building code should still build. Hence, -Werror is bad for
our use case. meson handles this via -D werror which is different from
-D warning_level and as long as the former is disabled, warnings in the
build do not cause harm (but may attract review attention for upstream
to fix).

buildtype is a completely unrelated concern, and the intention for
=plain is to disable debug or optimization settings that result in
codegen differences and thus different built artifacts. This must not
happen in distro builds because the *distributed programs* should
conform to policy settings.

Unfortunately, completely disabling warnings happens silently, and
cannot be overridden even if you really, really believe you know what
you're doing. It is thematically broken, since use of
add_project_arguments() to add more -W flags is not likewise ignored.
But if you try to add -Wall in that manner, meson will lecture you to
use warning_level which you cannot do. And if you have custom warning
flags which depend on options enabled by judicious use of -Wall via
default_options: 'warning_level=1', then you end up with generated
warnings complaining about your command line rather than your code, such
as:

cc1: warning: ‘-Wformat-y2k’ ignored without ‘-Wformat’ [-Wformat-y2k]
cc1: warning: ‘-Wformat-extra-args’ ignored without ‘-Wformat’ [-Wformat-extra-args]
cc1: warning: ‘-Wformat-zero-length’ ignored without ‘-Wformat’ [-Wformat-zero-length]
cc1: warning: ‘-Wformat-contains-nul’ ignored without ‘-Wformat’ [-Wformat-contains-nul]
cc1: warning: ‘-Wformat-security’ ignored without ‘-Wformat’ [-Wformat-security]

which then break the build with -Werror.

Throughout all this, a buildtype of ""plain"" does *not* disable -D
werror=true, which is the part where distro builds actually break down!

Users who both wish to disable debug/optimization codegen, *and* disable
warning commentary, are encouraged to do so by doing both, not by doing
one and having the other be assumed.

back to 'standard' which in this case means we literally create
profile for the profile file itself '/etc/apparmor.d/firejail-default'.

Overview
========

Flash has its own CORS-like mechanism (crossdomain.xml-based) and
therefore CORB (Cross-Origin Read Blocking) cannot be enforced for
requests initiated by Flash.

This CL avoids making an exception for plugins, unless the given
renderer process is actually hosting a Flash plugin (and is therefore
capable of proxying network requests on behalf of Flash).  This
means that the exception won't take place unless the user has
approved running Flash (via click-to-play / content settings /
enterprise policy - see the bug for more details).


Details
=======

This CL introduces a global set that stores process IDs of renderers
that host Flash.  This set lives either in the NetworkService process or
(if NetworkService feature is disabled) in the IO thread of the browser
process.  In both cases the global set is implemented and exposed by new
static methods of network::CrossOriginReadBlocking class.

The CL populates the global set from
PluginServiceImpl::FindOrStartPpapiPluginProcess after all the security
checks have been done and the plugin process is ready to be used or
launched.

The CL consults the global set before deciding to make a CORB exception
for a plugin request.  This is done from network::URLLoader (used if
NetworkService feature is enabled) and from
CrossSiteDocumentResourceHandler (used otherwise).

The CL removes items from the global set when RenderProcessHostImpl is
destroyed.

Getting this test working required a few fixes:
- Modifying a header rather than Set-Cookie for some tests, which
  required switching to XMLHttpRequest (crbug.com/827582)
- Handling redirect from http:// -> chrome-extension://, and bypassing
  security checks if this is from web request
- Plumbing through whether the request is async or not

This is not handling subresource redirects because subresource
redirects to schemes other than http/https/data are not supported
yet with network service (crbug.com/868545).

Also adds a bunch of tests for redirects.

This reverts commit 43a48785f23a65d5b3f0cefac086d67c3dea4eb0.

Reason for revert: This CL made the assumption that we didn't ship in any configurations that are instrumented or that are component builds.  However bug 853266 points out that CrOs ships in an asan configuration, so the rpath removal will still be necessary until the change in [1] is made.

[1] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=850682#c14

Original change's description:
> Stop removing rpath_for_built_shared_libraries from chrome_sandbox
>
> For instrumented builds like tsan, this causes chrome_sandbox to reference the
> wrong libc++.so due to a missing RPATH.
>
> Since all configurations we ship don't set RPATH, we don't have to worry about
> security vulnerabilities introduced by RPATH=$ORIGIN.  There's also a check to
> enforce this in chrome/installer/linux/common/installer.include.

For instrumented builds like tsan, this causes chrome_sandbox to reference the
wrong libc++.so due to a missing RPATH.

Since all configurations we ship don't set RPATH, we don't have to worry about
security vulnerabilities introduced by RPATH=$ORIGIN.  There's also a check to
enforce this in chrome/installer/linux/common/installer.include.

Cr-Commit-Position: 972c6d2dc6dd5efdad1377c0d224e03eb8f276f7@{#557568}","Do partial redirect handling in the renderer process for sync requests

Historically, blink has not received any intermediate resource loading
callbacks for sync requests. It simply blocked until the load finished
or failed, which meant that redirect security checks performed by blink
would be skipped (and in some cases we would try to reconstruct or do
a partial security check after the fact). SyncLoadContext allows us to
do more of these security checks before the redirect is sent. This
allows us to come closer to doing the correct thing for sync request
in general, and allows us to move some worker requests off-main-thread,
where before they had to proxy sync requests through the main thread in
order to get both proper redirect handling and the correct synchronous
behavior.

This CL ""cancels"" sync requests on redirect. WebURLLoaderImpl then
notifies blink of the redirect, which sends FetchContext callbacks (but
not ResourceClient callbacks). This allows us to do things CSP checking
on redirect. If blink permits the redirect, WebURLLoaderImpl manually
follows the redirect by issuing a new sync request.

ResourceClient callbacks aren't performed becuase sync requests have
historically not been associated with a ResourceClient. Doing so would
be a much large refactor, and would require careful handling to make sure
we didn't enter JS inside what is supposed to be a synchronous blocking
function.

We therefore need to continue to perform a rudimentary CORS check in
SyncLoadContext, which blocks cross-origin redirects if the
FetchRequestMode was anything other than kNoCors. This revealed a couple
of XML/XSLT callsites that should have been setting a FetchRequestMode but
weren't.

This adds a small D-Bus service framework to ash and then adds an
initial service that has one call ""OpenUrl"" which will then
open a new tab in Chrome with that URL. This is intended to be used by
Chrome OS clients that want to open a URL with Chrome; initial usage
will be from VMs.

>   APIs. Note that SQLite promises to maintain indefinite backwards
>   compatbility for SQL queries (modulo features disabled via

> * SQLITE_OMIT_PROGRESS_CALLBACK - Remove sqlite3_progress_handler(). We
>   don't use this feature, and the documentation says it comes with a
>   small performance penalty.

>   memory consumption standpoint, and we already do that for LevelDB.
>   Unfortunately, Chromium's SQLite databases use a variety of page
>   sizes, which makes cache sharing impossible.

Cr-Commit-Position: 972c6d2dc6dd5efdad1377c0d224e03eb8f276f7@{#533121}","sqlite: Disable unused features via compile-time options.

This CL shrinks the Linux binary by 34KB (138,266,816 to 138,232,320).
Code savings aside, this makes sure we don't unintentionally start
depending on these features.

The following compile-time options are recommended in the SQLite
documentation [1]:

* SQLITE_LIKE_DOESNT_MATCH_BLOBS - The LIKE and GLOB operators don't
  work on BLOB columns. This access pattern would be a performance
  wrench, so it's nice to fail hard here.
* SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED - This removes support for deprecated SQLite
  APIs. Note that SQLite promises to maintain indefinite backwards
  compatbility for SQL queries (modulo features disabled via
  compile-time options), so this only applies to the SQLite API. We
  should never be using deprecated APIs.
* SQLITE_OMIT_PROGRESS_CALLBACK - Remove sqlite3_progress_handler(). We
  don't use this feature, and the documentation says it comes with a
  small performance penalty.
* SQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE - Using a shared cache sounds nice from a
  memory consumption standpoint, and we already do that for LevelDB.
  Unfortunately, Chromium's SQLite databases use a variety of page
  sizes, which makes cache sharing impossible.
* SQLITE_USE_ALLOCA - Use alloca() instead of malloc() for allocating
  temporary spaces in functions. All of Chrome's platforms support this
  option, and it results in a slightly smaller binary and less heap churn.

The following compile-time options disable features that happen not to
be used.

* SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT: We initialize SQLite manually in //sql/connection.cc.
* SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET: We calls sqlite3_reset() correctly to reset prepared
  statements.
* SQLITE_OMIT_GET_TABLE: We don't use sqlite3_{get,free}_table().
* SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION: We don't use sqlite3_{enable_}load_extension().
  Asides from the code savings, there's a tiny security benefit to
  knowing that extension loading code is definitely not reachable from WebSQL.
* SQLITE_OMIT_TCL_VARIABLE: We don't use TCL variables.
* SQLITE_OMIT_TRACE: We don't use sqlite3_{profile,trace}().

different origins, depending on needs of individual tests.  This tweak

This reverts commit 9d5cafcaf5380fcaec80a4d0105df025b495d06f.

Original CL description:

When library CDM is enabled, when connecting to the MediaService, use a
CDM-type-specific CDM GUID as the service_manager Identity user ID, so
that the CDM service of each CDM type will run in its own MediaService
instance, in its own process!

This helps isolate different CDMs in it's own process for better
security and stability. This also makes the implementation simpler by
allowing CdmModule to be a per-process singleton that is initialized for
only one single CDM type.

To test the multiple_cdm_types.html in the browser (instead of in the
browser_test itself), you would need to:

1. Disable unique origin check in WebContentDecryptionModuleImpl::Create

2. Run the following command:

   out/GN/chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/foo
     --enable-features=MojoCdm,ExternalClearKeyForTesting,SupportExperimentalCdmInterface
     --register-pepper-plugins=""<path_to_chromium_repo>/src/out/GN/libclearkeycdmadapter.so;application/x-ppapi-clearkey-cdm""
     --clear-key-cdm-path-for-testing=<path_to_chromium_repo>/src/out/GN/libclearkeycdm.so
     file:///<path_to_chromium_repo>/src/media/test/data/multiple_cdm_types.html

In the future, we should be able drop  SupportExperimentalCdmInterface
and MojoCdm in --enable-features, as well as --register-pepper-plugins.

This reverts commit 7d0f75c321cae8a33f60fd291157d4c5d3fa9d01.

Reason: This change introduced a potential security risk,
wherein inserting particular strings of characters into a
text field could cause a DCHECK failure in
TextRunConstructor.cpp.

It should be relanded once it can be verified that it
doesn't cause a problem like https://crbug.com/751193.

This reverts commit 2212fff4c5c99b212506380f3a7310456ba7d2bd.

Reason for revert:
The mentioned test exception is seen before the original change:
https://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.gpu/builders/Linux%20Release%20%28NVIDIA%29/builds/108556
and after the revert:
https://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.gpu/builders/Mac%20Retina%20Release%20%28AMD%29/builds/12225
The original change hence should not be related.
It doesn't even touch any code compiled for windows or mac.

This reverts commit 00043bdefebe1d854b0cffbd1d35d90c0091057c.

Reason for revert: Removing the swapped out IPC filtering resulted in some layout tests to fail with Site Isolation. The ShellViewHostMsg_TextDump and ShellViewHostMsg_TestFinished IPCs are no longer filtered, which results in different test expectations.
The failing tests are:
http/tests/security/mixedContent/insecure-prefetch-in-main-frame.html
http/tests/security/mixedContent/blob-url-in-iframe.html
http/tests/inspector/change-iframe-src.html

        Fix issue that was causing integration test failure.

        In case of controller initiated connection, iid stamping
        was not happening. Before clustering code merge, iid stamping
        was done in updateData(), but after clustering code merge,
        it does not allow to make any changes to the device till
        owner of the device is selected by EntityOnwershipService,
        so updateData() was not stamping the iid to swtich. With this
        fix, once owner of the device is selected, it explictly stamp
        iid to the switch.

        NOTE: we should revert following patch before merging this patch
        https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/28309/1

        I ran the integration suit locally and it passes all the tests

        Temp workaround to debug southbound IT

        It is a timing change from the clustering code not taking into account some crazy existing code.

        This patch has a workaround that works in my local tests. I will merge it temporarily to see if the jenkins builds are good.

        Will work with Anil and Flavio on a long term solution.

        Old code:

        write ovsdb node to config ->
        -> dcl ->
        -> connect -> connect -> connectedButCallbacksNotRegistered -> putConnectionInstance
        -> updateData -> OvsdbNodeUpdateCommand - > ovsdb node - set Open_vSwitch external_ids
        *** key here is that the putConnectionInstance happened earlier in connect so now the OvsdbNodeUpdateCommand gets a chance to run and write the externalIds to the Open_vSwitch table
        ...
        OvsdbMonitorCallback -> OpenVSwitchUpdateCommand - > writes node to operational
        *** key here is that the iid (nodePath) is found by looking for the externalIds. If found, since it was written earlier, then it is used, if not the backup of using the uuid of the node is used. The IT expects the externalIds value to be there and that is the one with the form ip:port.

        In the new code:
        - putConnectionInstance() does not happen until the handleOwnership completes - too late since the updateData is processed before that
        - updateData doesn't do anything, complains about not finding client since the connectionInstance was not written earlier, therefore the externalIds are not written
        - OpenVSwitchUpdateCommand ends up using the wrong iid of the form using the uuid since the externalIds were not written.

        address whenever possible; instead of broadcast

        Modified ArpResolver and GatewayMacResolverService to use the unicast DA
        when known.  The code treats the DA as known for a new ARP request if
        one of the last N=2 ARP request was answered.

        Add setting controller for sfc it

        This patch adds setting the controller so that flows can be pushed to the switches.

        Use the following to initate the tests:

        start an ovsdb node and set it to be in passive mode: sudo ovs-vsctl set-manager ptcp:6640
        cd .../net-virt-sfc/it
        mvn -Dit.test=NetvirtSfcIT#testDoIt verify -Pintegrationtest -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=192.168.120.31

        The above will connect to the node and set's it controller to ODL.

    Revert ""Use single-argument form of firstKeyOf()""

    This reverts commit e19e4e3f10f65054aba16a94c082180f24b9beb6.

    This is breaking the net-virt code. Bridges are not getting created when OVSDB server connects to the controller. Probably happening because of single argument firstKeyOf() method.

","Temp workaround to debug southbound IT

It is a timing change from the clustering code not taking into account some crazy existing code.

This patch has a workaround that works in my local tests. I will merge it temporarily to see if the jenkins builds are good.

Will work with Anil and Flavio on a long term solution.

Old code:

write ovsdb node to config ->
-> dcl ->
-> connect -> connect -> connectedButCallbacksNotRegistered -> putConnectionInstance
-> updateData -> OvsdbNodeUpdateCommand - > ovsdb node - set Open_vSwitch external_ids
*** key here is that the putConnectionInstance happened earlier in connect so now the OvsdbNodeUpdateCommand gets a chance to run and write the externalIds to the Open_vSwitch table
...
OvsdbMonitorCallback -> OpenVSwitchUpdateCommand - > writes node to operational
*** key here is that the iid (nodePath) is found by looking for the externalIds. If found, since it was written earlier, then it is used, if not the backup of using the uuid of the node is used. The IT expects the externalIds value to be there and that is the one with the form ip:port.

In the new code:
- putConnectionInstance() does not happen until the handleOwnership completes - too late since the updateData is processed before that
- updateData doesn't do anything, complains about not finding client since the connectionInstance was not written earlier, therefore the externalIds are not written
- OpenVSwitchUpdateCommand ends up using the wrong iid of the form using the uuid since the externalIds were not written.

","images/tests: Globally-writeable /etc/passwd

This lets us SSH from the teardown container into the cluster without
hitting:

  $ ssh -A core@$bootstrap_ip
  No user exists for uid 1051910000

OpenSSH has a very early getpwuid call [1] with no provision for
bypassing via HOME or USER environment variables like we did for Bazel
[2].  OpenShift runs with the random UIDs by default [3]:

  By default, all containers that we try and launch within OpenShift,
  are set blocked from “RunAsAny” which basically means that they are
  not allowed to use a root user within the container.  This prevents
  root actions such as chown or chmod from being run and is a sensible
  security precaution as, should a user be able to perform a local
  exploit to break out of the container, then they would not be
  running as root on the underlying container host.  NB what about
  user-namespaces some of you are no doubt asking, these are
  definitely coming but the testing/hardening process is taking a
  while and whilst companies such as Red Hat are working hard in this
  space, there is still a way to go until they are ready for the
  mainstream.

while Kubernetes sorts out user namespacing [4].  Despite the high
UIDs, all users on the cluster are GID 0, so the g+w is sufficient
(vs. a+w), and maybe this mitigates concerns about increased
writability for such an important file.  The main mitigation is that
these are throw-away CI containers, and not long-running production
containers where we are concerned about malicious entry.

A more polished fix has landed in CRI-O [5], but the CI cluster is
stuck on OpenShift 3.11 and Docker at the moment.

Our SSH usecase is for gathering logs in the teardown container [6],
but we've been using the tests image for both tests and teardown since
b16dcfc7ce (images/tests/Dockerfile*: Install gzip for compressing
logs, 2019-02-19, #22094).

This reverts commit ab4f57212683baec45d5b682bdd3952ff58249ed.

The change is being reverted as it broke the Brocade FC SAN lookup
functionality.  The change uses configuration options from
ssh_utils that are not initialized when the Brocade driver is
run causing an exception to be thrown complaining that
CONF.ssh_hosts_key_file is used before it is initialized.

The right solution is to change the Brocade driver to use ssh_utils to

","Use dd conv=sparse when writing images to nodes

When using whole disk images, one generally wants the *virtual*
size of the image to be close to the size of the overcloud nodes'
physical disks (since no partition/logical volume/filesystem
expansion is done). As an example, one might end up with a 4GB
overcloud image (QCOW file) that has a virtual size of 100GB or
more.

Ironic uses qemu-img to convert this QCOW file to a ""raw"" image,
which is a *sparse* file. When the image is copied to an overcloud
node's disk (via iSCSI), we currently write all 100GB (mainly of
zeroes) across the network to the node's disk.

Adding conv=sparse to the dd command makes it skip the ""holes"" in
the image file; it will only the write the portions of the image
that actually contain data across the network.

from ports with disabled port security. And that broke L3HA routers
as keepalived processes couldn't talk to each other.
During attempt to fix that issue with keepalived we found out another
corner cases which we may break and in fact to fix them, we would
effectively revert this change and allow multicast traffic for all
ports in e.g. networks with ports which have port security and ports
which don't have port security and are on same node.
As we also don't really know what other corner cases we may hit going
further with that, lets revert this patch.

differences in handling multicast traffic between iptables and
openvswitch based firewall drivers.

","Process ingress multicast traffic for 224.0.0.X separately

By default, if any multicast traffic sent to 224.0.0.X is allowed
in the OVS firewall (that means there is a specific egress rule),
this traffic is sent, in table 73 (ACCEPT_OR_INGRESS_TABLE), to
a rule with action NORMAL.

As commented in the related bug, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4541,
chapter 2.1.2, section (2):
  ""Packets with a destination IP (DIP) address in the 224.0.0.X range
   which are not IGMP must be forwarded on all ports.""

That means those packets will be forwarded to all ports regardless of
any ingress rule. This patch process this traffic separately, sending
those packets to table 102 (MCAST_RULES_INGRESS_TABLE). In this table
the ingress rules that have a defined protocol, will have an Open Flow
rule to output the traffic directly to those ports associated to this
rule.

For example, in the problem reported in the related bug, the VRRP
protocol (112), will be sent only to those ports that have this
ingress rule.

neutron-openvswi-FORWARD chain to work properly.
Ports created with no security groups will not get skipped with current
code.
With fixed security groups check, these ports' security groups can not
be updated after creation.

extension to the main servers view builder. This, however,
caused a regression in the detailed listing of servers because
it didn't incorporate the caching mechanism used previously
by the extension so now for each server with details when
microversion 2.16 or greater is used (and the request passes
the policy check), we get the host status per server even if
we have multiple servers on the same host.

This moves the host_status processing out of the show() method
when listing servers with details and processes them in aggregate
similar to security groups and attached volumes.

One catch is the show() method handles instances from down cells
for us so we have to handle that separately in the new host_status
processing, but it's trivial (just don't get host_status for
instances without a host field set).

This reverts commit 9c0fe41281174b8bcd37378508e63228995befe0.

The reverted commit avoids overestimating dictionary index stream by
writing temporary dictionary index to a data stream and use the
buffered size of this stream as the estimation.

However, ORC spec requires dictionary to be sorted. Thus the dictionary
indices have to be re-indexed when flushing. In most case the estimated
size is close to the actual size. However under some rare corner cases,
the estimated size can be up to 6x smaller than the actual size, which
causes flushing huge stripes and becomes a reliability threat.

Here is an observed example: an column with ARRAY(VARCHAR), where
each cell contains the same array with about 30,000 elements.
The array is unsorted. Thus the temporary dictionary index
is [1, 2, 3, ...], while after re-indexing, the dictionary index
is a random shuffle.  The dictionary index streams exhibit
significantly different compression ratios under ZLIB.

The conclusion is with the re-indexing as the last step, it is
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to accurately estimate
the index stream size after compression.

We decide to fall back to the previous mechanism which tends to
over-estimate the stripe size, for the following reasons:

 1. While the previous heuristics flush small compressed stripes,
the uncompressed stripe size is as expected thus each stripe still
has enough data for computation engine to work on.

 2. Writing arbitrarily huge stripe is worse to Presto engine from
reliability perspective.

Note DWRF doesn't require dictionary to be sorted, in the future we can
add an option to write unsorted dictionary when writing DWRF files.
","Improve Stripe Size Estimation for SliceDictionaryColumnWriter

When writing dictionary encoded columns, the ORC write estimates
the buffered size based on (1) estimated index bytes per entry,
and (2) number of entries.

However, this doesn't account for the compression, which can be
very efficient when the dictionary indices are highly skewed.
For an extreme example, thinking about dictionary has 1M entires,
yet one value appeared all the time, while all the other (1M - 1)
entires only appeared once.

We have observed written stripe size is only 10M ~ 20M when the
estimated stripe size is full at 64MB for real workloads..

This commit makes SliceDictionaryColumnWriter also writes the
dictionary index to a temporary data stream, and use the buffered
size of that stream to estimate stripe size.

Note the uncompressed dictionary IDs can be too large to store in
memory. Thus we uncompress and read the dictionary ids from the
temporary data stream.

Reason for revert: The original revert was done because of security
vulnerability in JGit. This vulnerability was fixed meantime.

Another argument for procrastination with Git v2 protocol support in
upcoming Gerrit release may be the fact that we do not have any
integration tests for execution of AdvertiseRefsHook hook.

However, this argument is not specific for git v2 protocol, as
mentioned in JGit 5.0 release: [1], but other Git protocol versions
were affected as well, and thus does not hold. In fact bidirectional
v0 HTTP protocol also has not executed AdvertiseRefsHook hook and
this was not discovered for 8 years and all released Gerrit versions
were affected.

Test Plan:

1. Install git version 2.18 or later
2. Activate git v2 protocol on the client side
3. Enable git v2 protocol support in gerrit, by setting this config:
   receive.enableProtocolV2 = true
3. Run $ GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git ls-remote
4. Confirm that git v2 protocol is used
5. Confirm that the method: DefaultRefFilter#filter is get called
6. Confirm that the call stack looks sane: [2]

This reverts commit fcc90699fdec17b941a473221d228c832a533fc0.

Reason for revert: Security vulnerability for OAuth and OpenID auth
schemes.

OAuth and OpenID authentication schemes support multiple identity
providers, e.g.: CAS-OAuth2 and GitHub-OAuth2. An attacker can easily
impersonate existing Gerrit user by creating account on a different
provider with exactly the same username as the existing Gerrit account.
Instead of creating a fresh new user, the new account is erroneously
linked to the existing Gerrit account, even though, account linking
feature was not triggered from the Gerrit UI.

The original commit tried to fix intermittent database corruption
problem, with missing record in the database, in the context of single
identity provider (LDAP) where such problem doesn't exist, as there is
no way that one single username can belong to physical different users.
Nevertheless, there should be found another workaround, as trying to
recover on the fly and introducing severe security breach for other auth
schemes supported in Gerrit.

If all else fails, the missing database record has to be inserted
manually and the corresponding account must be re-indexed.

Change-Id: Icba3452c153b2ae3cc1a4ebc569342641f38c07c
","Fix the missing DB entry in Gerrit DB

Due to an unknown reason (still under investigation), a few of the new
LDAP users were not able to login after first time because the Gerrit DB
was missing one of the two entries needed to authenticate the user (the
second entry is only needed for the users with non-null usernames).
The entry with external Id - ""gerrit:abc"" was never inserted to DB
in such cases whereas the entry with external id - ""username:abc"" was
created resulting in an account creation for the user.

This causes inconsistency in the DB. An account gets created in first login
attempt and second attempt fails to create missing external id because the
""username:abc"" entry already exists causing the DB action to rollback.

As this bug is very infrequent and hard to replicate, this change
provides an after-fix for the issue i.e. fixes the problem when an entry
is missing in Gerrit DB. It checks if there exists an account already
for the given username and links the newly created external ID to that
account. It prevents the need to manually enter the missing entries in
DB to solve the issue.

","Exclude bouncycastle key files to fix SecurityException upon plugin-api

Exclude the 2 bouncycastle key files from the 2 downloaded jar files
that are repackaged into our gerrit plugin-api jar. Do so in order to
fix a SecurityException [1] thrown upon using the plugin api from plugin
IT tests [2] in standalone (non-tree) mode.

Indeed, BCKEY.DSA and BCKEY.SF used to be repackaged under META-INF/ in
our gerrit plugin-api jar. Doing so caused that exception [1], as such
BCKEY files did not properly sign our built plugin-api jar; they
strictly belonged to their 2 mother bouncycastle jar files. Our jar used
to have 2 sets of such key files, one set coming from bcprov and the
other from bcpg (the 2 bouncycastle libs involved herein). This fix
removes them all 4 (BC key files) from the resulting plugin-api jar:

jar tvf gerrit-plugin-api-2.12-SNAPSHOT.jar | grep BCKEY
=> (before this fix)
 26965 Sun Mar 01 12:09:10 EST 2015 META-INF/BCKEY.SF
  2219 Sun Mar 01 12:09:10 EST 2015 META-INF/BCKEY.DSA

  2219 Sun Mar 01 12:09:32 EST 2015 META-INF/BCKEY.DSA

This fix is first for plugin IT tests [2], which expose this issue as
the first 'pure' plugin-api jar loaders. Such BC libs started to be
-needfully- introduced in acceptance testing by commit ed170f3.

This reverts commit dfd3c31a3f9eea96854b2d22574856368e86b245.

As Metze pointed out:

From MS-SMB2 section 2.2.4:

SMB2_NEGOTIATE_SIGNING_ENABLED

When set, indicates that security signatures are enabled
on the server. The server MUST set this bit, and the client MUST return
STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE if the flag is missing.

I'll submit a documentation bug to fix #9222 that way.
","Fix bug #9222 - smbd ignores the ""server signing = no"" setting for SMB2.

Still sign if client request is signed, just don't negotiate it in
negprot or sessionsetup.

* slack orb doesn't work on Windows :/

* Revert testing changes.

* Use correct pip cache directory.

* Log response on assert failure to make it easier to troubleshoot.

* Ignore bandit false positive.

* Also try run coverage with Windows unit tests.

* Update comments.

* Try using custom orb which works on Windows executor.

* Test that specifying ""shell: bash"" also works for OS X and Linux jobs.

* Move more of the orb code in-line until my fix pr has been merged.

* Specify Windows slack orb configuration so it matches configuration for

This reverts commit b857c7b75db40ee1a17a21278d3ee22b481a66fc.
","skills: provide different security snippets for skill and slot side

Security snippets allow snaps to gain the permission needed to interact
with a skill. So far only the consumer (use) side of the security was
taken care of. This patch replaces the Type.SecuritySnippet() with two
methods: Type.SkillSecuritySnippet() and Type.SlotSecuritySnippet().

A snap that offers a skill will be granted additional permissions
expressed by SkillSecuritySnippet(). A snap that uses a skill will be
granted additional permissions expressed by SlotSecuritySnippet().

For a practical example, a snap that offers GPIOs as bool-files might
gain access to /sys/class/gpio/{export,unexport} while a snap that uses
those skills will only gain access to /sys/class/gpio/gpio$number/value.

","Cache Control only written if not set

Previously Spring Security always wrote cache control headers and relied
on the application to override the values. This can cause problems with
cache control. For example, applications may only set cache control if
the header is not already set. Additionally, setting of Cache-Control
should disable writing of Pragma.

This commit delays writing headers until just before the response is
committed and only writes the Cache Control headers if they do not exist.

Passing multiple user providers to the context listener does not make
much sense. The listener is only responsible to refresh users for a
particular firewall. Thus, it must only be aware of the user provider
for this particular firewall.

There is no need for the context listener to be aware of all the configured user providers. It must only use the provider for the current firewall (the one identified by the context key passed to the constructor) to refresh the user from the session.

The previously mentioned commit inadvertently broke a lot of SELinux related

TBH, I think that privilege separation between processes running under the same
UID is tenuous. Even with drm, in common setups any user process can ptrace the
""current owner of the display"" and call DROP_MASTER or do whatever. It *is*
possible to prevent that, e.g. by disabling ptrace using yama.ptrace_scope, or
selinux, and so on, but afaik this is not commonly done. E.g. all Fedora
systems pull in elfutils-default-yama-scope.rpm through dependencies which sets
yama.ptrace_scope=0. And even assuming that ptrace was disabled, it is trivial
to modify files on disk, communicate through dbus, etc; there is just to many
ways for a non-sandboxed process to interact maliciously with the display shell
to close them all off. To achieve real protection, some sort of sandboxing
must be implemented, and in that case there is no need to rely on access mode
on the device files, since much more stringent measures have to be implemented
anyway.

The situation is similar for framebuffer devices. It is common to add
framebuffer users to video group to allow them unlimited access to /dev/fb*.
Using uaccess would be better solution in that case. Also, since there is no
""current owner"" limitation like in DRM, processes running under the same UID
should be able to access /proc/<pid-of-display-server>/fd/* and gain access to
the devices. Nevertheless, weston implements a suid wrapper to access the
devices and then drop privileges, and this patch would make this daemon
pointless. So if the weston developers feel that this change reduces security,
I prefer to revert it.

Summary:
This commit broke Jupyter notebook integration: a content security
policy that whitelists Colab also blocks access by any Jupyter
notebooks.

I don’t see a simple fix for this other than permitting all frame
ancestors: Jupyter origins are arbitrary, and we can’t use `'self'`
because Jupyter and TensorBoard are not in fact served from the same
origin.

This reverts commit ff05d1af8d118d0add237766980d31163a94c40b.

Test Plan:
Build the Pip package, then install it into a virtualenv with Jupyter.
From a Jupyter notebook, run `%tensorboard --logdir logs`. Before this
commit, that rendered an empty cell and printed a console error,

> Refused to display 'http://localhost:6006/' in a frame because an
> ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive:
> ""frame-ancestors https://\*.googleusercontent.com
> https://\*.google.com"".

As of this commit, this renders a working TensorBoard.

wchargin-branch: revert-colab-csp","core: add CSP header for Colab output frames (#2390)

Summary:
This is required to use the new `google.colab.kernel.proxyPort` Colab
feature (see Google-internal <http://b/130310433>).

Test Plan:
The included tests verify that the mechanism is implemented as intended.
To verify that the mechanism actually works in Colab, create a Colab
notebook with the following cells:

```python
import werkzeug

@werkzeug.Request.application
def app(request):
  frame_ancestors = request.args.get(""frame_ancestors"")
  response = werkzeug.Response(""Hello, %s!\n"" % (frame_ancestors,))
  response.headers[""Content-Type""] = ""text/html""
  if frame_ancestors is not None:
    response.headers[""Content-Security-Policy""] = (
        ""frame-ancestors %s"" % frame_ancestors
    )
  return response
```

```python
import threading
import werkzeug.serving

if ""server"" in locals():
  server.shutdown()
server = werkzeug.serving.ThreadedWSGIServer(""localhost"", 2345, app)
threading.Thread(target=server.serve_forever).start()
```

```
!curl -i localhost:2345?frame_ancestors=foo
```

```javascript
%%javascript
google.colab.kernel.proxyPort(2345).then((base) => {
  const ancestors = ""https://*.googleusercontent.com https://*.google.com"";
  const url = new URL(
      ""?frame_ancestors="" + encodeURIComponent(ancestors),
      base,
  );
  const iframe = document.createElement(""iframe"");
  iframe.src = url.toString();
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
});
```

Run the notebook and verify that the final output frame renders
properly:

![Screenshot of output frame with intended “Hello” message][1]

Note that when changing the `iframe.src` to just `base`, the iframe
instead renders a “sad page”, and that a console error indicates that
the culprit is `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin`.

```console
$ make testacc TESTARGS='-run=TestAccXXX'
==> Checking that code complies with gofmt requirements...

Error: Skipping example acceptance testing pattern. Update TESTARGS to match the test naming in the relevant *_test.go file.

For example if updating aws/resource_aws_acm_certificate.go, use the test names in aws/resource_aws_acm_certificate_test.go starting with TestAcc and up to the underscore:
make testacc TESTARGS='-run=TestAccAWSAcmCertificate_'

can be empty or a bool representation

testing all possible inputs

now testing as well `delete_on_termination = """"` and
`delete_on_termination = null` which both should not set the value to
anything.

Appears that the provider reverted the deprecation of the `organization` argument and inclusion of the new `owner` argument in 2.9.x, delaying until 3.0.0.

Previously:

```

Update provider's S3 bucket lookup to use GetBucketRegion utility (#14221)

* Update provider's S3 bucket lookup to use GetBucketRegion utility

Replaces the usage of S3's GetBucketLocation with the aws-sdk-go's
GetBucketRegion utility. This utility can discover the bucket's region
without authentication, and can be configured to be compatible with
FIPS endpoints.

Fixes https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/14217
Related to https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/3115

* Add AWS SDK for Go s3manager dependency

Adds a dependency on the AWS SDK for Go's `s3manager`, and `s3iface`
packages. These packages make the s3manager packages's GetBucketRegion
utility available for discovering a S3 bucket's locations.

These packages are used by PR #14221.

2) It's not to us to judge if it has no use-case (in fact it has, ex: two dev

This PR enables CTIA to run with either Elasticsearch 5 or 7. it impacts most store operations including:
- mapping
- index initialization
- CRUD
- bulk
switching between ES 5 and ES 7 is possible throw the configuration by simply setting the parameter `ctia.store.default.es.version`. It is also configurable per store like other ES parameters and indeed we could migrate iteratively stores and have stores on ES5 and some stores on ES7 while performing the migration.

⚠️ I must disable the mapping update. I prepared the switch to ES7 which requires mapping changes of existing fields. Once this PR will be merged it will be not possible to add new fields mapping through CTIA task. If anyone needs to introduce new fields before the migration, I can update mappings manually if you tell me a nice joke.
Updating an existing field mapping with `include_in_all` does not make the mapping update fail like any other update of existing field mapping. We need to disable it until ES7 migration, and have a simple control on this. This PR includes the ability to disable mapping/setting update directly from the properties. The default value is false for a better control on the indices life cycle.


For compatibility reason it impacts the migration task and the removal of `include_in_all` which are also mostly handled here (with some few details that will be handled in coming PR dedicated to this).
The compatibility between the 2 versions are mostly delegated to our new ES library, ductile. Depending on the queried ES version, which is now part of the connection fields, ductile builds the proper uri/parameters. I kept the corresponding PR opened: https://github.com/threatgrid/ductile/pull/5.

Since I tried to delegate as far as possible the compatibility to ductile, most of the changes are in the tests to enable testing both ES 5 and ES 7. An helper macro slightly derived from the one used in ductile is used for testing both version. The `Hide whitespace changes` should protect your eyes :-).

As a reminder the migration process is as follow, for each ENV:
- let CTIA runs on current Elasticsearch cluster and indices
- start migration task (4 billion documents on NAM private CTIA, should take 1 week)
- when migration task is complete restart on new cluster / indices
As mentioned this process could be decompose for each ENV / store.",true

Reload the current thread's FPU state, which contains the guest's FPU
state, to the CPU registers if necessary during vcpu_enter_guest().
TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD can be set any time control is transferred out of KVM,
e.g. if I/O is triggered during a KVM call to get_user_pages() or if a
softirq occurs while KVM is scheduled in.

Moving the handling of TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD from vcpu_enter_guest() to
kvm_arch_vcpu_load(), effectively kvm_sched_in(), papered over a bug
where kvm_put_guest_fpu() failed to account for TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD.  The
easiest way to the kvm_put_guest_fpu() bug was to run with involuntary
preemption enable, thus handling TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD during kvm_sched_in()
made the bug go away.  But, removing the handling in vcpu_enter_guest()
exposed KVM to the rare case of a softirq triggering kernel_fpu_begin()
between vcpu_load() and vcpu_enter_guest().

Now that kvm_{load,put}_guest_fpu() correctly handle TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD,
revert the commit to both restore the vcpu_enter_guest() behavior and
eliminate the superfluous switch_fpu_return() in kvm_arch_vcpu_load().

Note, leaving the handling in kvm_arch_vcpu_load() isn't wrong per se,
but it is unnecessary, and most critically, makes it extremely difficult
to find bugs such as the kvm_put_guest_fpu() issue due to shrinking the
window where a softirq can corrupt state.

A sample trace triggered by warning if TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD is set while
vcpu state is loaded:

","KVM: X86: Fix fpu state crash in kvm guest

The idea before commit 240c35a37 (which has just been reverted)
was that we have the following FPU states:

               userspace (QEMU)             guest
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
               processor                    vcpu->arch.guest_fpu
>>> KVM_RUN: kvm_load_guest_fpu
               vcpu->arch.user_fpu          processor
>>> preempt out
               vcpu->arch.user_fpu          current->thread.fpu
>>> preempt in
               vcpu->arch.user_fpu          processor
>>> back to userspace
>>> kvm_put_guest_fpu
               processor                    vcpu->arch.guest_fpu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the new lazy model we want to get the state back to the processor
when schedule in from current->thread.fpu.

In ubifs_mount(), 'c' is allocated through kzalloc() in alloc_ubifs_info().
However, it is not deallocated in the following execution if
ubifs_fill_super() fails, leading to a memory leak bug. To fix this issue,
free 'c' before going to the 'out_deact' label.

As Pavel Machek reported:

""We normally use -EUCLEAN to signal filesystem corruption. Plus, it is
good idea to report it to the syslog and mark filesystem as ""needing
fsck"" if filesystem can do that.""

Still we need improve the original patch with:
- use unlikely keyword
- add message print
- return EUCLEAN

However, after rethink this patch, I don't think we should add such
condition check here as below reasons:
- We have already checked the field in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt(),
- If there is fs corrupt or security vulnerability, there is nothing
to guarantee the field is integrated after the check, unless we do
the check before each of its use, however no filesystem does that.
- We only have similar check for bitmap, which was added due to there
is bitmap corruption happened on f2fs' runtime in product.
- There are so many key fields in SB/CP/NAT did have such check
after f2fs_sanity_check_{sb,cp,..}.

So I propose to revert this unneeded check.

This reverts commit 574823bfab82d9d8fa47f422778043fbb4b4f50e.

It turns out that my hope that we could just remove the code that
exposes the cache residency status from mincore() was too optimistic.

There are various random users that want it, and one example would be
the Netflix database cluster maintenance. To quote Josh Snyder:

 ""For Netflix, losing accurate information from the mincore syscall
  would lengthen database cluster maintenance operations from days to
  months. We rely on cross-process mincore to migrate the contents of a
  page cache from machine to machine, and across reboots.

  To do this, I wrote and maintain happycache [1], a page cache
  dumper/loader tool. It is quite similar in architecture to pgfincore,
  except that it is agnostic to workload. The gist of happycache's
  operation is ""produce a dump of residence status for each page, do
  some operation, then reload exactly the same pages which were present
  before."" happycache is entirely dependent on accurate reporting of the
  in-core status of file-backed pages, as accessed by another process.

  We primarily use happycache with Cassandra, which (like Postgres +
  pgfincore) relies heavily on OS page cache to reduce disk accesses.
  Because our workloads never experience a cold page cache, we are able
  to provision hardware for a peak utilization level that is far lower
  than the hypothetical ""every query is a cache miss"" peak.

  A database warmed by happycache can be ready for service in seconds
  (bounded only by the performance of the drives and the I/O subsystem),
  with no period of in-service degradation. By contrast, putting a
  database in service without a page cache entails a potentially
  unbounded period of degradation (at Netflix, the time to populate a
  single node's cache via natural cache misses varies by workload from
  hours to weeks). If a single node upgrade were to take weeks, then
  upgrading an entire cluster would take months. Since we want to apply
  security upgrades (and other things) on a somewhat tighter schedule,
  we would have to develop more complex solutions to provide the same
  functionality already provided by mincore.

  At the bottom line, happycache is designed to benignly exploit the
  same information leak documented in the paper [2]. I think it makes
  perfect sense to remove cross-process mincore functionality from
  unprivileged users, but not to remove it entirely""

We do have an alternate approach that limits the cache residency
reporting only to processes that have write permissions to the file, so
we can fix the original information leak issue that way.  It involves
_adding_ code rather than removing it, which is sad, but hey, at least
we haven't found any users that would find the restrictions
unacceptable.

So revert the optimistic first approach to make room for that alternate
fix instead.

","Change mincore() to count ""mapped"" pages rather than ""cached"" pages

The semantics of what ""in core"" means for the mincore() system call are
somewhat unclear, but Linux has always (since 2.3.52, which is when
mincore() was initially done) treated it as ""page is available in page
cache"" rather than ""page is mapped in the mapping"".

The problem with that traditional semantic is that it exposes a lot of
system cache state that it really probably shouldn't, and that users
shouldn't really even care about.

So let's try to avoid that information leak by simply changing the
semantics to be that mincore() counts actual mapped pages, not pages
that might be cheaply mapped if they were faulted (note the ""might be""
part of the old semantics: being in the cache doesn't actually guarantee
that you can access them without IO anyway, since things like network
filesystems may have to revalidate the cache before use).

In many ways the old semantics were somewhat insane even aside from the
information leak issue.  From the very beginning (and that beginning is
a long time ago: 2.3.52 was released in March 2000, I think), the code
had a comment saying

  Later we can get more picky about what ""in core"" means precisely.

and this is that ""later"".  Admittedly it is much later than is really
comfortable.

NOTE! This is a real semantic change, and it is for example known to
change the output of ""fincore"", since that program literally does a
mmmap without populating it, and then doing ""mincore()"" on that mapping
that doesn't actually have any pages in it.

I'm hoping that nobody actually has any workflow that cares, and the
info leak is real.

We may have to do something different if it turns out that people have
valid reasons to want the old semantics, and if we can limit the
information leak sanely.

Userspace applications have been modified to write security xattrs,
but they are not context aware.  In the case of security.ima, the
security xattr can be either a file hash or a file signature.
Permitting writing one, but not the other requires the application to
be context aware.

In addition, userspace applications might write files to a staging
area, which might not be in policy, and then change some file metadata
(eg. owner) making it in policy.  As a result, these files are not
labeled properly.

This reverts commit c68ed80c97d9720f51ef31fe91560fdd1e121533, which
prevents writing file hashes as security.ima xattrs.

This reverts commit bc07c2c6e9ed125d362af0214b6313dca180cb08.

While the aim is increased security for --x memory maps, it does not
protect against kernel level reads. Until SECCOMP is implemented for
arm64, revert this patch to avoid giving a false idea of execute-only
mappings.

","arm64: Introduce execute-only page access permissions

The ARMv8 architecture allows execute-only user permissions by clearing
the PTE_UXN and PTE_USER bits. The kernel, however, can still access
such page, so execute-only page permission does not protect against
read(2)/write(2) etc. accesses. Systems requiring such protection must
implement/enable features like SECCOMP.

This patch changes the arm64 __P100 and __S100 protection_map[] macros
to the new __PAGE_EXECONLY attributes. A side effect is that
pte_valid_user() no longer triggers for __PAGE_EXECONLY since PTE_USER
isn't set. To work around this, the check is done on the PTE_NG bit via
the pte_valid_ng() macro. VM_READ is also checked now for page faults.

This reverts commit bb2314b47996491bbc5add73633905c3120b6268.

It wasn't necessarily wrong per se, but we're still busily discussing
the exact details of this all, so I'm going to revert it for now.

It's true that you can already do flink() through /proc and that flink()
isn't new.  But as Brad Spengler points out, some secure environments do
not mount proc, and flink adds a new interface that can avoid path
lookup of the source for those kinds of environments.

We may re-do this (and even mark it for stable backporting back in 3.11
and possibly earlier) once the whole discussion about the interface is done.

","fs: Allow unprivileged linkat(..., AT_EMPTY_PATH) aka flink

Every now and then someone proposes a new flink syscall, and this spawns
a long discussion of whether it would be a security problem.  I think
that this is missing the point: flink is *already* allowed without
privilege as long as /proc is mounted -- it's called AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW.

Now that O_TMPFILE is here, the ability to create a file with O_TMPFILE,
write it, and link it in is very convenient.  The only problem is that
it requires that /proc be mounted so that you can do:

linkat(AT_FDCWD, ""/proc/self/fd/<tmpfd>"", dfd, path, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)

This sucks -- it's much nicer to do:

linkat(tmpfd, """", dfd, path, AT_EMPTY_PATH)

Let's allow it.

If this turns out to be excessively scary, it we could instead require
that the inode in question be I_LINKABLE, but this seems pointless given
the /proc situation

This reverts commit d2a7009f0bb03fa22ad08dd25472efa0568126b9.

J. R. Okajima explains:

 ""After this commit, I am afraid access(2) on NFS may not work
  correctly.  The scenario based upon my guess.
   - access(2) overrides the credentials.
   - calls inode_permission() -- ... -- generic_permission() --
      ns_capable().
   - while the old ns_capable() calls security_capable(current_cred()),
     the new ns_capable() calls has_ns_capability(current) --
     security_capable(__task_cred(t)).

  current_cred() returns current->cred which is effective (overridden)
  credentials, but __task_cred(current) returns current->real_cred (the
  NFSD's credential).  And the overridden credentials by access(2) lost.""

","proc: fix races against execve() of /proc/PID/fd**

fd* files are restricted to the task's owner, and other users may not get
direct access to them.  But one may open any of these files and run any
setuid program, keeping opened file descriptors.  As there are permission
checks on open(), but not on readdir() and read(), operations on the kept
file descriptors will not be checked.  It makes it possible to violate
procfs permission model.

Reading fdinfo/* may disclosure current fds' position and flags, reading
directory contents of fdinfo/ and fd/ may disclosure the number of opened
files by the target task.  This information is not sensible per se, but it
can reveal some private information (like length of a password stored in a
file) under certain conditions.

Used existing (un)lock_trace functions to check for ptrace_may_access(),
but instead of using EPERM return code from it use EACCES to be consistent
with existing proc_pid_follow_link()/proc_pid_readlink() return code.  If
they differ, attacker can guess what fds exist by analyzing stat() return
code.  Patched handlers: stat() for fd/*, stat() and read() for fdindo/*,
readdir() and lookup() for fd/ and fdinfo/.

","Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP connection establishment

In hci_conn_security ( which is used during L2CAP connection
establishment ) test for HCI_CONN_ENCRYPT_PEND state also
sets this state, which is bogus and leads to connection time-out
on L2CAP sockets in certain situations (especially when
using non-ssp devices )

This reverts commit 242631c49d4cf39642741d6627750151b058233b.

Conflicts:

	security/selinux/hooks.c

SELinux used to recognize certain individual ioctls and check
permissions based on the knowledge of the individual ioctl.  In commit
242631c49d4cf396 the SELinux code stopped trying to understand
individual ioctls and to instead looked at the ioctl access bits to
determine in we should check read or write for that operation.  This
same suggestion was made to SMACK (and I believe copied into TOMOYO).
But this suggestion is total rubbish.  The ioctl access bits are
actually the access requirements for the structure being passed into the
ioctl, and are completely unrelated to the operation of the ioctl or the
object the ioctl is being performed upon.

Take FS_IOC_FIEMAP as an example.  FS_IOC_FIEMAP is defined as:

FS_IOC_FIEMAP _IOWR('f', 11, struct fiemap)

So it has access bits R and W.  What this really means is that the
kernel is going to both read and write to the struct fiemap.  It has
nothing at all to do with the operations that this ioctl might perform
on the file itself!

","selinux: simplify ioctl checking

Simplify and improve the robustness of the SELinux ioctl checking by
using the ""access mode"" bits of the ioctl command to determine the
permission check rather than dealing with individual command values.
This removes any knowledge of specific ioctl commands from SELinux
and follows the same guidance we gave to Smack earlier.

This reverts commit 47970b1b2aa64464bc0a9543e86361a622ae7c03.

It turns out it breaks several distributions.  Looks like the stricter
selinux checks fail due to selinux policies not being set to allow the
access - breaking X, but also lspci.

So while the change was clearly the RightThing(tm) to do in theory, in
practice we have backwards compatibility issues making it not work.

","pci: use security_capable() when checking capablities during config space read

Eric Paris noted that commit de139a3 (""pci: check caps from sysfs file
open to read device dependent config space"") caused the capability check
to bypass security modules and potentially auditing.  Rectify this by
calling security_capable() when checking the open file's capabilities
for config space reads.

This reverts commit 045309820afe047920a50de25634dab46a1e851d. That
commit is wrong for two reasons:

- The conn->sec_level shouldn't be updated without performing
authentication first (as it's supposed to represent the level of
security that the existing connection has)

- A higher auth_type value doesn't mean ""more secure"" like the commit
seems to assume. E.g. dedicated bonding with MITM protection is 0x03
whereas general bonding without MITM protection is 0x04. hci_conn_auth
already takes care of updating conn->auth_type so hci_connect doesn't
need to do it.

This reverts commit f520360d93cdc37de5d972dac4bf3bdef6a7f6a7.

Tetsuo Handa, running a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y and
CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH=/sbin/hotplug, has been hitting RCU detected
CPU stalls: it's been spinning in the loop where do_execve() counts up
the args (but why wasn't fixup_exception working? dunno).

The recent change, switching kobject_uevent_env() from UMH_WAIT_EXEC
to UMH_NO_WAIT, is broken: the exec uses args on the local stack here,
and an env which is kfreed as soon as call_usermodehelper() returns.
It very much needs to wait for the exec to be done.

An alternative would be to keep the UMH_NO_WAIT, and complicate the code
to allocate and free these resources correctly? but no, as GregKH
pointed out when making the commit, CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH="""" is a
much better optimization - though some distros are still saying
/sbin/hotplug in their .config, yet with no such binary in their initrd
or their root.

","kobject: don't block for each kobject_uevent

Right now, the kobject_uevent code blocks for each uevent that's being
generated, due to using (for hystoric reasons) UHM_WAIT_EXEC as flag to
call_usermode_helper().  Specifically, the effect is that each uevent
that is being sent causes the code to wake up keventd, then block until
keventd has processed the work. Needless to say, this happens many times
during the system boot.

This patches changes that to UHN_NO_WAIT (brilliant name for a constant
btw) so that we only schedule the work to fire the uevent message, but
do not wait for keventd to process the work.

This removes one of the bottlenecks during boot; each one of them is
only a small effect, but the sum of them does add up.

[Note, distros that need this are broken, they should be setting
CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH to """", that way this code path will never be
excuted at all -- gregkh]

I'm pretty sure you meant to write here `md-alignment-[vertical]-[horizontal]`, but in the docs it says `md-alignment-[horizontal]-[vertical]`. That threw me off for a bit.

Overall, this is a super awesome package! I love working with it!!

* fix typo in api section

I noticed that at the bottom of the page, in the API section, the order also needs to be reversed. ""x"" should refer to horizontal, and ""y"" should refer to vertical.

I'm pretty sure you meant to write here `md-alignment-[vertical]-[horizontal]`, but in the docs it says `md-alignment-[horizontal]-[vertical]`. That threw me off for a bit.

Overall, this is a super awesome package! I love working with it!!

* fix typo in api section

I noticed that at the bottom of the page, in the API section, the order also needs to be reversed. ""x"" should refer to horizontal, and ""y"" should refer to vertical.

while we wait for a security readiness review of the geoip2 library.
(However, these configs should be reinstated once geoip2 is available,
and prior to deployment: T266136)

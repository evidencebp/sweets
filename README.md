# [Security](https://github.com/evidencebp/sweets/tree/main/security) 
Security related commits.
Also has reverted security commits, hence the leading to the security problem.

# [Performance](https://github.com/evidencebp/sweets/tree/main/performance)
Commits dealing with performance issues (e.g. running time, memory).

# [commit-labeling](https://github.com/evidencebp/sweets/tree/main/commit-labeling)

A dataset of commits, labeled by various language models.
By comparaing different models predictions on these commits one can use active learning to identify informative commits and further imrpve the models.
